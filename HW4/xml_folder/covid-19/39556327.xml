According to the World Health Organization Global Tuberculosis Report, in 2022, 7.5 million new tuberculosis cases were identified, marking the highest number of cases since the World Health Organization initiated its worldwide tuberculosis surveillance program in 1995. The 2019 peak was 7.1 million cases, with 5.8 million cases in 2020 and 6.4 million in 2021. The increase in 2022, which may be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic complicating tuberculosis case tracing, has raised concerns. To better understand the regulation spectrum of <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i> <i>mraZ</i> under hypoxia, we performed a transcriptome analysis of <i>M. smegmatis</i> mutant and wild-type strains using Illumina Agilent 5300 sequencing. The study identified 6898 differentially expressed genes, which were annotated with NCBI nonredundant protein sequences, a manually annotated and reviewed protein sequence database, Pfam, Clusters of Orthologous Groups of Proteins, Gene Ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. Several mycobacteria transcriptional regulators, virulence genes, membrane transporters, and cell wall biosynthesis genes were annotated. These data serve as a valuable resource for future investigations and may offer insight into the development of drugs to combat <i>M. tuberculosis</i> infection.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Suleiman</LastName><ForeName>Ismail Mohamed</ForeName><Initials>IM</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0003-3063-6627</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Institute of Modern Biopharmaceuticals, State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Eco-Environment and Bio-Resource of the Three Gorges Area, Key Laboratory of Eco-Environments in Three Gorges Reservoir Region, Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Southwest University, Beibei, Chongqing 400715, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Science and Laboratory Technology, Dar-es-Salaam Institute of Technology, Bibititi and Morogoro Rd Junction, P.O.
