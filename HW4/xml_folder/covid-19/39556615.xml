This has led to breakthrough infections (BTI) in vaccinated individuals, with a large proportion of the neutralizing antibody response targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein. Immune imprinting, where prior exposure of the immune system to an antigen can influence the response to subsequent exposures, and its role in a population with heterogenous exposure histories has important implications in future vaccine design. Here, we develop an accessible approach to map epitope immunodominance of the neutralizing antibody response in sera. By using a panel of mutant Spike proteins in a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay, we observed distinct epitope usage in convalescent donors infected during wave 1, or infected with the Delta, or BA.1 variants, highlighting the antigenic diversity of the variant Spikes. Analysis of longitudinal serum samples taken spanning 3 doses of COVID-19 vaccine and subsequent breakthrough infection, showed the influence of immune imprinting from the ancestral-based vaccine, where reactivation of existing B cells elicited by the vaccine resulted in the enrichment of the pre-existing epitope immunodominance. However, subtle shifts in epitope usage in sera were observed following BTI by Omicron sub-lineage variants. Antigenic distance of Spike, time after last exposure, and number of vaccine boosters may play a role in the persistence of imprinting from the vaccine. This study provides insight into RBD neutralizing epitope usage in individuals with varying exposure histories and has implications for design of future SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright: Â© 2024 Seow et al.
