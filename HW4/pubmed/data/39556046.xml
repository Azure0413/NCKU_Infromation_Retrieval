Telepractice promotes accessibility to therapy services for those in rural environments, lowers the frequency of missed appointments, and reduces the costs of rehabilitation. The efficacy of telepractice has been scarcely explored in the aphasia literature. Preliminary research has demonstrated comparable results of telepractice and in-person therapy for people with aphasia, but the current scope of research is insufficient to guide clinical practice. The present study examined whether the virtual administration of a picture-naming therapy paradigm was as effective as in-person administration.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHOD" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The treatment effects of two similar clinical trials, one completed in-person (<i>n</i> = 13) and one completed virtually (<i>n</i> = 13), are compared. Participants were adults with chronic (&gt; 6 months) poststroke aphasia. Both clinical trials administered Cued Picture-Naming Therapy 4 days a week for 2 weeks (eight treatment sessions). Treatment outcomes were analyzed using Tau-<i>U</i> effect sizes and Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> tests.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Weighted Tau-<i>U</i> averages showed an advantage of telepractice over in-person treatment in the acquisition effects of trained words, with participants demonstrating a very large effect (0.84, <i>p</i> &lt; .01) following telepractice and a large effect (0.75, <i>p</i> &lt; .01) following in-person treatment. Both telepractice and in-person rehabilitation demonstrated significant treatment effects and were not significantly different from each other per Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> independent-samples <i>t</i> tests.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The present study demonstrated that telepractice of a picture-naming paradigm is as effective as in-person treatment administration. This justifies the use of telepractice to overcome accessibility and cost barriers to speech therapy administration and justifies taking patient preference into account. Future research should explore the efficacy of telepractice for treatments that promote greater generalizability to functional communication.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.27641031.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Jewell</LastName><ForeName>Courtney C</ForeName><Initials>CC</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0009-0005-8359-299X</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Speech and Hearing Science, College of Arts and Sciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Diedrichs</LastName><ForeName>Victoria A</ForeName><Initials>VA</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0001-5516-174X</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Speech and Hearing Science, College of Arts and Sciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, Chicago, IL.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Blackett</LastName><ForeName>Deena Schwen</ForeName><Initials>DS</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-7769-5870</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Speech and Hearing Science, College of Arts and Sciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, College of Health Professions, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Durfee</LastName><ForeName>Alexandra Zezinka</ForeName><Initials>AZ</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0003-2067-8217</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Speech and Hearing Science, College of Arts and Sciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Speech-Language Pathology &amp; Audiology, Towson University, MD.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Harnish</LastName><ForeName>Stacy M</ForeName><Initials>SM</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0003-4987-9653</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Speech and Hearing Science, College of Arts and Sciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>11</Month><Day>18</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>Am J Speech Lang Pathol</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>9114726</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1058-0360</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>11</Month><Day>18</Day><Hour>16</Hour><Minute>20</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>11</Month><Day>18</Day><Hour>16</Hour><Minute>20</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>11</Month><Day>18</Day><Hour>10</Hour><Minute>13</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39556046</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1044/2024_AJSLP-24-00172</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
