Exogenous antioxidants have been recognised for their potential to alleviate these age-related health complications. Virgin coconut oil (VCO), known for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-lipidemic efficacies, has gained recognition as a functional food with promising benefits. However, the safety of VCO consumption among individuals of the aged and diseased population remains to be fully established.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS AND RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Five experimental groups were established, consisting of one control group and four groups administered either "2 mL" or "4 mL" per kg body weight of "HP-VCO" or "F-VCO" daily for six weeks. Body weight, water, and feed intake were monitored. After six weeks, animals were euthanized, blood and organs were collected for analysis. Oxidative stress and dyslipidemia markers were analysed, and liver tissues underwent histological examination. HP-VCO-administered animals exhibited increased serum total cholesterol and triglycerides, whereas F-VCO-fed animals showed reduced triglyceride levels. LDL-cholesterol levels decreased in all VCO-fed groups, accompanied by increased HDL-cholesterol levels. Additionally, all treated groups showed a slight increase in the HMG Co. A/mevalonate ratio. Both VCO-fed animals displayed elevated reduced glutathione levels and reduced glutathione - S transferase activity. Consistent with these findings, decreased conjugated dienes and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances confirmed the improved redox status.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The study indicated that F-VCO is advantageous over VCO prepared by hot pressing as it offers protection against oxidative stress and related degenerative diseases.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024 The Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.
