The present study aimed to thoroughly describe the changes in lipid profiles in <i>Monascus purpureus</i> by absolute quantitative lipidomics and tandem mass tag-based quantitative proteomics. The results showed that ammonium chloride stress (15 g/L) increased MP production while inhibiting ergosterol biosynthesis, leading to an imbalance in membrane lipid homeostasis in <i>Monascus</i>. In response to the imbalance of lipid homeostasis, the regulation mechanism of phospholipids in <i>Monascus</i> was implemented, including the inhibition of lysophospholipids production, maintenance of the ratio of PC/PE, and improvement of the biosynthesis of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, and cardiolipin with high saturated and long carbon chain fatty acids through the CDP-DG pathway rather than the Kennedy pathway. The inhibition of lysophospholipid biosynthesis was attributed to the upregulated expression of protein and its gene related to lysophospholipase NTE1, while maintenance of the PC/PE ratio was achieved by the upregulated expression of protein and its gene related to CTP: phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase and phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase in the Kennedy pathway. These findings provide insights into the regulation mechanism of MP biosynthesis from new perspectives.IMPORTANCE<i>Monascus</i> is important in food microbiology as it produces natural colorants known as <i>Monascus</i> pigments (MPs). The industrial production of MPs has been achieved by liquid fermentation, in which the nitrogen source (especially ammonium chloride) is a key nutritional parameter. Previous studies have investigated the regulatory mechanisms of substance and energy metabolism, as well as the cross-protective mechanisms in <i>Monascus</i> in response to ammonium chloride stress. Our research in this work demonstrated that ammonium chloride stress also caused an imbalance of membrane lipid homeostasis in <i>Monascus</i> due to the inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis. We found that the regulation mechanism of phospholipids in <i>Monascus</i> was implemented, including inhibition of lysophospholipids production, maintenance of the ratio of PC/PE, and improvement of biosynthesis of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, and cardiolipin with high saturated and long carbon chain fatty acids through the CDP-DG pathway. These findings further refine the regulatory mechanisms of MP production and secretion.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y" EqualContrib="Y"><LastName>Jiang</LastName><ForeName>Xiaofei</ForeName><Initials>X</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Hunan Key Laboratory of Forestry Edible Sources Safety and Processing, Changsha, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>School of Food Science and Engineering, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y" EqualContrib="Y"><LastName>Hong</LastName><ForeName>Xiya</ForeName><Initials>X</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Hunan Key Laboratory of Forestry Edible Sources Safety and Processing, Changsha, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>School of Food Science and Engineering, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y" EqualContrib="Y"><LastName>Wang</LastName><ForeName>Zhulin</ForeName><Initials>Z</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Hunan Key Laboratory of Forestry Edible Sources Safety and Processing, Changsha, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>School of Food Science and Engineering, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Liu</LastName><ForeName>Jun</ForeName><Initials>J</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Hunan Key Laboratory of Forestry Edible Sources Safety and Processing, Changsha, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>School of Food Science and Engineering, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Zhong</LastName><ForeName>Haiyan</ForeName><Initials>H</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Hunan Key Laboratory of Forestry Edible Sources Safety and Processing, Changsha, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>School of Food Science and Engineering, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Ren</LastName><ForeName>Jiali</ForeName><Initials>J</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Hunan Key Laboratory of Forestry Edible Sources Safety and Processing, Changsha, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>School of Food Science and Engineering, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Zhou</LastName><ForeName>Bo</ForeName><Initials>B</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0001-6336-4651</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Hunan Key Laboratory of Forestry Edible Sources Safety and Processing, Changsha, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>School of Food Science and Engineering, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>09</Month><Day>17</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>Appl Environ Microbiol</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>7605801</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>0099-2240</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">CDP-DG pathway</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Kennedy pathway</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Monascus pigments</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">ergosterol</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">membrane lipid homeostasis</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>17</Day><Hour>21</Hour><Minute>47</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>17</Day><Hour>21</Hour><Minute>47</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>17</Day><Hour>9</Hour><Minute>3</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39287399</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1128/aem.01146-24</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
