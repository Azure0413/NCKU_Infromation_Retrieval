Subcellular localization, gene expression analysis, dual-luciferase reporter assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and transgenic Arabidopsis experiments were performed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of AbMYB11 in regulating disease resistance.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">MeJA application greatly improved mushroom resistance to P. tolaasii infection, and suppression of the phenylpropanoid pathway significantly weakened this effect. MeJA treatment stimulated the accumulation of phenylpropanoid metabolites, which was accompanied by increased the activities of biosynthetic enzymes and the expression of phenylpropanoid pathway-related genes (AbPAL1, Ab4CL1, AbC4H1) and an AbPR-like gene, further confirming the critical role of the phenylpropanoid pathway in MeJA-induced responses to P. tolaasii. Importantly, AbMYB11, localized in the nucleus, was rapidly induced by MeJA treatment under P. tolaasii infection; it transcriptionally activated the phenylpropanoid pathway-related and AbPR-like genes, and AbMYB11 overexpression in Arabidopsis significantly increased the transcription of phenylpropanoid-related genes, the accumulation of total phenolics and flavonoids, and improved resistance to P. tolaasii.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">This study clarified the pivotal role of AbMYB11 as a regulator in disease resistance by modulating the phenylpropanoid pathway, providing a novel idea for the breeding of highly disease-resistant edible mushrooms and plants.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2024.
