Data has shown that the most impact may actually be seen with the use of OIT in younger infants and toddlers.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">To evaluate the safety and feasibility of OIT in subjects younger than 24 months in a real-world setting using commercially available food products.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">This was a retrospective study of subjects 24 months and younger initiated on OIT for peanut, tree nut, or sesame allergy within the Scripps Clinic allergy department. Medical records were reviewed for data regarding initial oral food challenges (OFCs), OIT, and adverse outcomes.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Fifty-two subjects under 24 months of age were initiated on OIT. Most subjects (84.6%) were on single food OIT, some (15.4%) were on multi-food OIT. No increased adverse outcomes were observed on multi-food OIT. Of the 59 initial OFCs, objective reactions occurred during 42 challenges, the majority being low grade reactions. During initial OFCs, 86.1% of peanut allergic children tolerated 1/8 of one Bamba stick with no reaction. The majority (73.1%) of subjects up-dosed at home and most (51.9%) had no reactions while up-dosing. Some had low grade cutaneous reactions, none requiring epinephrine or emergency evaluation.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">OIT in infants is safe and feasible to perform in a real-world setting using commercially available food products with at home up-dosing, thus increasing the availability of OIT for patients.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2024.
