Due to a wide range of sources, low toxicity, and high specificity, MBPs have now received extensive attention in the fields of food, medicine, and cosmetics. The structure of MBPs determines their biological activities. Therefore, it is essential to analyze the relationship between the structure and bioactivity of MBPs. Because of the advantages of mild conditions, high specificity, safety, and environmental friendliness, enzymatic hydrolysis has become the most commonly used method to produce MBPs. However, the high cost and low yield of enzymatic methods have motivated researchers to search for alternative technologies. Novel pretreatments like ultrasound, microwave, high hydrostatic pressure, and pulsed electric fields have been employed in the production of MBPs. By inducing protein unfolding and increasing enzymatic cleavage sites, these techniques have been demonstrated to accelerate protein hydrolysis and enhance the biological activity of MBPs. This article reviews recent research advances on marine-derived protein hydrolysates and peptides, discusses the relationship between their biological activity and structure, and compares the mechanisms of action of different novel technologies used to promote protein hydrolysis and enhance the biological activity of MBPs. In addition, the current challenges facing the development and application of MBPs are outlined and possible future work in tackling these challenges is also suggested in the current review. It is hoped that this review can promote further development and application of marine active substances.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Tang</LastName><ForeName>Cai-Die</ForeName><Initials>CD</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>School of Food Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Academy of Contemporary Food Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre, Guangzhou, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Engineering and Technological Research Centre of Guangdong Province on Intelligent Sensing and Process Control of Cold Chain Foods, &amp; Guangdong Province Engineering Laboratory for Intelligent Cold Chain Logistics Equipment for Agricultural Products, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre, Guangzhou, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Cheng</LastName><ForeName>Jun-Hu</ForeName><Initials>JH</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>School of Food Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Academy of Contemporary Food Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre, Guangzhou, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Engineering and Technological Research Centre of Guangdong Province on Intelligent Sensing and Process Control of Cold Chain Foods, &amp; Guangdong Province Engineering Laboratory for Intelligent Cold Chain Logistics Equipment for Agricultural Products, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre, Guangzhou, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Sun</LastName><ForeName>Da-Wen</ForeName><Initials>DW</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-3634-9963</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>School of Food Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Academy of Contemporary Food Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre, Guangzhou, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Engineering and Technological Research Centre of Guangdong Province on Intelligent Sensing and Process Control of Cold Chain Foods, &amp; Guangdong Province Engineering Laboratory for Intelligent Cold Chain Logistics Equipment for Agricultural Products, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre, Guangzhou, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Food Refrigeration and Computerized Food Technology (FRCFT), Agriculture and Food Science Centre, University College Dublin, National University of Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType><PublicationType UI="D016454">Review</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>09</Month><Day>15</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>8914818</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1040-8398</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Marine bioactive peptides</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">enzymatic hydrolysis</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">molecular weight</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">novel technologies</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">structure-activity relationships</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>16</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>22</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>16</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>22</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>16</Day><Hour>1</Hour><Minute>43</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39279224</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1080/10408398.2024.2399293</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
