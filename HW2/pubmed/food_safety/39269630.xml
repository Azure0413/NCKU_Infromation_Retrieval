The excessive intake of the two colorants can cause health damage. According to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the acceptable daily intake (ADI) of canthaxanthin and β-apo-8'-carotenoid ethyl ester are 0.03 mg/kg·bw and 0.015 mg/kg·bw, respectively. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (UPLC-DAD) was used to determine two colorants in chicken eggs and meat. A PRiME HLB solid-phase extraction cartridge was used to extract and clean-up the sample. BEH C18 column was used as the separation column, with water containing 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile as the mobile phase. The limit of detection (LOD) was 0.05 mg/kg, and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.1 mg/kg. The recoveries were between 90% and 104%. The daily intake of two colorants in chicken eggs and meat was evaluated based on the detection data, food consumption data and weight data of the population. The mean estimated daily intake (EDI) values of canthaxanthin through chicken eggs and meat were 1.09 µg/(kg·bw·d) and 0.013 µg/(kg·bw·d), respectively. The mean EDI value of β-apo-8'-carotenoid ethyl ester through eggs was 0.44 µg/(kg·bw·d). The results showed that eggs were the main contributor to the daily intake of two colorants. The mean hazard quotients (HQ) values of two colorants through chicken eggs and meat was within a safe range.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Li</LastName><ForeName>Xinghua</ForeName><Initials>X</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Institute of Health Inspection and Testing, Tianjin, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Yang</LastName><ForeName>Siyu</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Institute of Health Inspection and Testing, Tianjin, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Jin</LastName><ForeName>Weiyi</ForeName><Initials>W</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Institute of Health Inspection and Testing, Tianjin, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Jia</LastName><ForeName>Yeqing</ForeName><Initials>Y</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Institute of Health Inspection and Testing, Tianjin, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>An</LastName><ForeName>Kang</ForeName><Initials>K</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Shandong First Medical University &amp; Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, School of Public Health and Health Administration, Jinan, Shandong, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Li</LastName><ForeName>Jianping</ForeName><Initials>J</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Institute of Health Inspection and Testing, Tianjin, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Zhang</LastName><ForeName>Yi</ForeName><Initials>Y</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Institute of Health Inspection and Testing, Tianjin, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>09</Month><Day>13</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>England</Country><MedlineTA>Food Addit Contam Part A Chem Anal Control Expo Risk Assess</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101485040</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1944-0057</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">UPLC-DAD</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">canthaxanthin</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">chicken eggs</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">chicken meat</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">β-apo-8’-carotenoid ethyl ester</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>13</Day><Hour>14</Hour><Minute>45</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>13</Day><Hour>14</Hour><Minute>45</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>13</Day><Hour>11</Hour><Minute>13</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39269630</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1080/19440049.2024.2401973</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
