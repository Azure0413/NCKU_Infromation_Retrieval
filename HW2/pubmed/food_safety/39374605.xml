Although a seroprotective threshold has not been defined for those at occupational risk of exposure, the current vaccine strategy is to attain a sustained high level of antibody titres. The aim of this trial was to explore the effects of delayed boosting upon both the height and duration of antibody titres following primary immunisation.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">In this open-label phase 2 randomised controlled trial, we compared antibody titres at month 36 in participants who had received a homologous booster dose at month 18 following primary immunisation with those who had received no booster. From Oct 25, 2016, to Jan 29, 2020, healthy adults aged 18 years or older deemed at occupational risk of exposure to Ebola virus due to laboratory work, clinical duties, or travel to an active endemic region were recruited from four hospital clinics in the USA and one hospital clinic in Canada and received primary vaccination with 2×10<sup>7</sup> plaque-forming unit per mL of VSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP. 18 months later, individuals who consented and were still eligible were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either a homologous booster dose or no booster. Study visits for safety and serial blood collections for antibody titres were done on enrolled participants at months 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 19, 24, 30, and 36. Through July, 2021, a web-based application was used for randomisation, including assignments with schedules for each of the five sites using mixed permuted blocks. The trial was not masked to participants or site staff. The primary endpoint was a comparison of geometric mean titres (GMTs) of anti-Ebola virus glycoprotein IgG antibody at month 36 (ie, 18 months after randomisation) for all randomly assigned participants who completed the 36 months of follow-up (primary analysis cohort). Investigators were aware of antibody titres from baseline (enrolment) through month 18 but were masked to summary data by randomisation group after month 18. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02788227).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="FINDINGS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Of the 248 participants who enrolled and received their primary immunisation, 114 proceeded to the randomisation step at month 18. The two randomisation groups were balanced: 57 participants (24 [42%] of whom were female; median age was 42 years [IQR 35-50]) were randomly assigned to the booster group and 57 (24 [42%] of whom were female; median age was 42 years [IQR 36-51]) to the no-booster group. Of those randomly assigned, 92 participants (45 in the booster group and 47 in the no-booster group) completed 36 months of follow-up. At 18 months after primary immunisation, GMTs in the no-booster group increased from a baseline of 10 ELISA units (EU)/mL (95% CI 7-14) to 1451 EU/mL (1118-1882); GMTs in the booster group increased from 9 EU/mL (6-16) to 1769 EU/mL (1348-2321). At month 19, GMTs were 31 408 EU/mL (23 181-42 554) for the booster group and 1406 EU/mL (1078-1833) for the no-booster group; at month 36, GMTs were 10 146 EU/mL (7960-12 933) for the booster group and 1240 EU/mL (984-1563) for the no-booster group. Accordingly, the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of antibody titres had increased almost 21-fold more in the booster versus no-booster group at 1 month after booster administration (GMR 20·6; 95% CI 18·2-23·0; p&lt;0·0001) and was still over 7-fold higher at month 36 (GMR 7·8; 95% CI 5·5-10·2; p&lt;0·0001). Consistent with previous reports of this vaccine's side-effects, transient mono-articular or oligo-articular arthritis was diagnosed in 18 (9%) of 207 primary vaccination recipients; after randomisation, arthritis was diagnosed in one (2%) of 57 participants in the no-booster group. No new cases of arthritis developed after booster administration. Four serious adverse events occurred following randomisation: one (epistaxis) in the booster group and three (gastrointestinal haemorrhage, prostate cancer, and tachyarrhythmia) in the no-booster group. None of the serious adverse events was judged attributable to the booster vaccination assignment.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="INTERPRETATION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">In addition to no new safety concerns and in marked contrast to earlier trials evaluating short-term boosting, delaying a rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP booster until month 18 resulted in an increase in GMT that remained several-fold above the no-booster group GMT for at least 18 months. These findings could have implications for defining the optimal timing of booster doses as pre-exposure prophylaxis in populations at ongoing risk for Ebola virus exposure.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="FUNDING" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">The Division of Intramural Research and the Division of Clinical Research of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the US National Institutes of Health, Canadian Immunization Research Network through the Public Health Agency of Canada, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Published by Elsevier Ltd.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Davey</LastName><ForeName>Richard T</ForeName><Initials>RT</Initials><Suffix>Jr</Suffix><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.
