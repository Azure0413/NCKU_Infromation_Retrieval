Using the 2000 Census and 2001-13 American Community Survey linked to the Social Security Administration's NUMIDENT, we leverage the county-level rollout of the Food Stamps program between 1961 and 1975. We find that children with access to greater economic resources before age five have better outcomes as adults. The treatment-on-the-treated effects show a 6% of a standard deviation improvement in human capital, 3% of a standard deviation increase in economic self-sufficiency, 8% of a standard deviation increase in the quality of neighbourhood of residence, a 1.2-year increase in life expectancy, and a 0.5 percentage-point decrease in likelihood of being incarcerated. These estimates suggest that Food Stamps' transfer of resources to families is a highly cost-effective investment in young children, yielding a marginal value of public funds of approximately sixty-two.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Bailey</LastName><ForeName>Martha J</ForeName><Initials>MJ</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>University of California-Los Angeles and NBER, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Hoynes</LastName><ForeName>Hilary</ForeName><Initials>H</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>University of California at Berkeley and NBER, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Rossin-Slater</LastName><ForeName>Maya</ForeName><Initials>M</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Stanford University and NBER, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Walker</LastName><ForeName>Reed</ForeName><Initials>R</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>University of California at Berkeley and NBER, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><GrantList CompleteYN="Y"><Grant><GrantID>R03 HD066145</GrantID><Acronym>HD</Acronym><Agency>NICHD NIH HHS</Agency><Country>United States</Country></Grant><Grant><GrantID>P2C HD041028</GrantID><Acronym>HD</Acronym><Agency>NICHD NIH HHS</Agency><Country>United States</Country></Grant><Grant><GrantID>T32 AG000221</GrantID><Acronym>AG</Acronym><Agency>NIA NIH HHS</Agency><Country>United States</Country></Grant><Grant><GrantID>R01 HD070950</GrantID><Acronym>HD</Acronym><Agency>NICHD NIH HHS</Agency><Country>United States</Country></Grant><Grant><GrantID>P2C HD041022</GrantID><Acronym>HD</Acronym><Agency>NICHD NIH HHS</Agency><Country>United States</Country></Grant><Grant><GrantID>R03 HD058065</GrantID><Acronym>HD</Acronym><Agency>NICHD NIH HHS</Agency><Country>United States</Country></Grant></GrantList><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2023</Year><Month>06</Month><Day>08</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>England</Country><MedlineTA>Rev Econ Stud</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101085345</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>0034-6527</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Food Stamps</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">I18</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">I31</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">I38</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">J13</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">J24</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Long-run</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Social safety net</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>17</Day><Hour>10</Hour><Minute>44</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>17</Day><Hour>10</Hour><Minute>43</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>16</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>14</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pmc-release"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>13</Day></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>ppublish</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39281422</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="mid">NIHMS1965273</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="pmc">PMC11395512</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1093/restud/rdad063</ArticleId></ArticleIdList><ReferenceList><Reference><Citation>AIZER A, ELI S, FERRIE J, et al.
