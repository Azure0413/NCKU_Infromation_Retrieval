However, it is not sufficiently managed because of a lack of established standards. This study was conducted to monitor pesticide residues in fishery and seaweed product samples and assess the risk to humans. A total of 454 fishery products and 38 seaweed products were examined, and seven pesticides were detected. Among these, ethoxyquin was the most frequently detected. The risk of ethoxyquin via chronic exposure was 0.16 % and 83 % for the average and 97.5th intake, respectively. A risk exceeding 80 % is concerning; however, this concentration is considered safe in real-world circumstances, such as washing and cooking processes. Therefore, the detected pesticide residues in this study were assessed to be safe level for Korean intake level of fishery products. However, DDT, the prohibited pesticide decades ago, was still found and it is necessary to keep monitor considering persistent of pesticides. Considering newly regulated pesticides, sufficient monitoring and risk assessment data such as this study should be provided for policy standards setting and management.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.
