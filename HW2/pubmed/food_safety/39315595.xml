Procyanidins (PC) are known for their antiangiogenic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimetastatic properties. However, there is comparatively limited information on how PC interacts with UC. In this study, 5 mg/10 mL/kg body weight of PC was administered to mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice. PC treatment prolonged the survival period of mice, ameliorated UC symptoms, reduced damage to the intestinal mucosal barrier, and increased the protein expression of ZO-1 and occludin in the DSS-treated mice. Importantly, PC treatment significantly reduced gene expression related to Th17 cell differentiation, including STAT3, SMAD3, TGF-Î², and JAK1. The results of the flow cytometry analysis indicated significant increase in the number of Treg cells and a concomitant decrease in the proportion of Th17 cells in the colon following PC treatment. Additionally, PC increased the abundance of gut microbiota such as <i>Bacteroidota</i>, <i>Oscillospiraceae</i>, <i>Muribaculaceae,</i> and <i>Desulfovibrionaceae</i>, as well as the concentrations of acetate acid, propionate acid, and butyrate acid in the feces. PC also activated short-chain fatty acid receptors, such as G-protein coupled receptor 43 in the colon, which promoted the proliferation of Treg cells. The depletion of gut microbiota and subsequent transplantation of fecal microbiota demonstrated that PC's effects on gut microbiota were effective in improving UC and restoring intestinal Th17/Treg homeostasis in a microbiota-dependent manner. This suggests that PC could be a promising functional food for the prevention and treatment of UC in the future.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Sun</LastName><ForeName>Benyue</ForeName><Initials>B</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>State Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Key Laboratory of Industrial Microbiology, Ministry of Education, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Industry Microbiology, National and Local United Engineering Lab of Metabolic Control Fermentation Technology, China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Food Nutrition/Safety and Medicinal Chemistry, College of Biotechnology, Tianjin University of Science &amp;
