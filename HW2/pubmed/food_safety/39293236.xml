ARV infections in turkeys have been associated with arthritis, lameness and neurological disorders, and cost the US economy approximately USD 33 million per year. There is not a commercial vaccine available and the shortage of turkey ARV (TRV) genomic data hinders the efforts to explore the molecular epidemiology of this virus, although several studies suggest a close relationship between European TRVs and TRVs present in the US. This study shows a snapshot of the genomic diversity of Avian orthoreoviruses (ARV) circulating in Germany in the mid-2000s. Through a deep genomic analysis of 18 ARV isolates recovered from sick turkeys, we observed that co-infection was a common condition. 80% of the samples showed signs of a simultaneous infection with a TRV and a chicken ARV (CRV). We believe this is the first reported evidence of CRV and TRV naturally occurring co-infections in commercial turkeys. These co-infection events were identified due to the significant genomic diversity observed among ARV infecting various production bird species. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed a consistent host-associated ARV clustering, with three main clades: (i) a TRV clade, (ii) a CRV clade, and (iii) a Duck ARV (DRV)/Goose ARV (GRV) clade. Furthermore, our findings indicate that German TRVs have interacted with their European and American counterparts, suggesting active mobilization of the virus, likely through the commercial trading of live animals. However, we also consider the potential role of migratory birds in the international movement of ARV.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2024.
