In this study, the physical barriers of native and cooked highland barley (HB), brown rice (BR), and oats (OA) kernels and their contribution to starch digestion were investigated. The resistant starch content was similar in cereal flours, but varied among cooked kernels (HB &gt; BR &gt; OA: 45.05 %, 10.30 %, and 24.71 %). The water adsorption, gelatinization enthalpy, and decrease in hardness of HB kernels were lower than those of OA and BR kernels. Microstructural observations of native kernels showed that HB had the thickest cell walls. After cooking, the lowest cell wall deformation and a dense continuous network developed from the protein matrix were observed in HB kernels. During digestion, undigested starch granules encapsulated by the stable cell walls and strong protein network were observed in HB kernels, but not in BR or OA kernels. Furthermore, the heavily milled HB kernels still had more resistant starch than the intact OA and BR kernels. Therefore, the physical barriers of HB kernels exhibited stronger inhibition of starch gelatinization and digestion. Differences in cereal physical barriers led to various inhibitory effects.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024.
