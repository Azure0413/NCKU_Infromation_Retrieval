Therefore, this review aimed to determine the levels of ochratoxin A (OTA) in coffee worldwide and then estimate its human intake and health risks. The systematic search took place from June 1997 to April 2024 and 40 of 254 articles were selected based on the selection criteria. The results showed significant differences in average levels of OTA between countries, continents and coffee types (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Of 3256 samples, OTA was detected in 1778, accounting for 54.6% of the total, with the percentage of positive results varying between 7.5% and 100%. Only two studies reported OTA average levels in roasted coffee exceeding the maximum limit (ML) set by the European Commission (ML-EC = 5 μg/kg). The average OTA in soluble coffee was lower than ML-EC (10 μg/kg) in all studies, and in instant coffee, the level of OTA was higher than ML-EC (10 μg/kg) only in one study. The estimated daily intake (EDI) of OTA in all coffee types was lower than the provisional tolerable daily intake (PTDI) values set by joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) (14 ng/kg bw/day) and proposed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) (17 ng/kg bw/day). Non-carcinogenic risk assessment through coffee consumption indicated that the hazard quotient (HQ) was below the acceptable level, HQ = 1. The Margin of Exposure (MoE) for neoplastic effects was acceptable and unacceptable for non-neoplastic effects (NNE) in 4.5% (one of 22 cases) of the roasted and soluble coffees, but acceptable for all instant coffees. In conclusion, the study shows that the OTA content of coffee is not toxic to consumers worldwide. However, preventative measures should be taken, including inhibiting fungal growth and reducing OTA-producing fungal growth.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Massahi</LastName><ForeName>Tooraj</ForeName><Initials>T</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Research Center for Environmental Determinants of Health (RCEDH), Research Institute for Health, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Students Research Committee, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Kiani</LastName><ForeName>Amir</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Regenerative Medicine Research Center (RMRC), Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Health Institute, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Moradi</LastName><ForeName>Masoud</ForeName><Initials>M</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Research Center for Environmental Determinants of Health (RCEDH), Research Institute for Health, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Soleimani</LastName><ForeName>Hamed</ForeName><Initials>H</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Environmental Health Engineering, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Student's Scientific Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Omer</LastName><ForeName>Abdullah Khalid</ForeName><Initials>AK</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Food Hygiene and Quality Control, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Habibollahi</LastName><ForeName>Mohammad Hossein</ForeName><Initials>MH</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Laboratory Sciences, Zahedan Branch, Islamic Azad University, Zahedan, Iran.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Mansouri</LastName><ForeName>Borhan</ForeName><Initials>B</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0001-5411-5362</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Substance Abuse Prevention Research Center, Research Institute for Health, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Sharafi</LastName><ForeName>Kiomars</ForeName><Initials>K</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Social Development and Health Promotion Research Center, Health Institute, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType><PublicationType UI="D016454">Review</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>09</Month><Day>11</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>England</Country><MedlineTA>Food Addit Contam Part A Chem Anal Control Expo Risk Assess</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101485040</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1944-0057</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Ochratoxin A</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">coffee products</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">health risk assessment</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">mycotoxins</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>11</Day><Hour>20</Hour><Minute>42</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>11</Day><Hour>20</Hour><Minute>42</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>11</Day><Hour>15</Hour><Minute>13</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39259858</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1080/19440049.2024.2400697</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
