Previous studies have not fully characterized the transboundary food-related water footprints by regional income groups. Taking Guangdong as an example, this study calculates the local and transboundary food-related water footprints by income groups and explores relevant socioeconomic factors during 2007-2017. Results show that the proportion of transboundary food-related water footprints by income groups has increased during 2007-2017. By 2017, nearly half of food-related water footprints of income groups happened in external regions. In particular, the high-income groups of Guangdong transferred large amounts of food-related water footprints to specific northern regions (e.g., Heilongjiang and Jilin). However, socioeconomic changes of these northern regions contributed to the increase of food-related water footprints by income groups. Fortunately, the transitions of food consumption structures of income groups helped to reduce the external food-related water footprints. We also observed that the effects of dietary behavior changes were group heterogeneous. The findings of this study can provide scientific foundations for group-targeted dietary behavior optimization to reduce water footprints, as well as interregional collaboration for sustainable food and water resource management.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
