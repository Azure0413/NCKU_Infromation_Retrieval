For this purpose, an ICP-MS method including a sample pre-treatment based on microwave-assisted digestion was developed and validated. Elemental ion release from lead crystal glasses into artificial tap water, 0.5% citric acid solution and white wine, respectively, was only analysed for Pb. Within 24â€‰h, Pb release from crystal glass was shown to increase with time. To account for repeated use, at least three consecutive release experiments were performed, which showed - with one remarkable exception - constant or decreasing levels of element ion release. However, after four months resting period, Pb release from crystal glass was higher than before. In contrast, all 21 elemental ions were detected to be released from the hip flasks into 0.5% citric acid solution, apple liqueur and herb liqueur, respectively. Release of Cd, Cr, Ni, As, TI, Sn and most prominently Pb from hip flasks was in the range of and above the respective release limit (SRL) as set by the Council of Europe (CoE). When focussing on the third repetition, only one out of six hip flasks met the suggested SRL for all determined elements in all test solutions. This demonstrates both, that the SRLs of the CoE can be met and that producers of hip flasks may have to review their manufacturing processes.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>von Leliwa</LastName><ForeName>Sarah</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Chemical and Product Safety, German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR), Berlin, Germany.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Schmidt</LastName><ForeName>Roman</ForeName><Initials>R</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Chemical and Product Safety, German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR), Berlin, Germany.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Andrievskih</LastName><ForeName>Svetlana</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Chemical and Product Safety, German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR), Berlin, Germany.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Tietz</LastName><ForeName>Thomas</ForeName><Initials>T</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Chemical and Product Safety, German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR), Berlin, Germany.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Merkel</LastName><ForeName>Stefan</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Chemical and Product Safety, German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR), Berlin, Germany.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Luch</LastName><ForeName>Andreas</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Chemical and Product Safety, German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR), Berlin, Germany.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Kappenstein</LastName><ForeName>Oliver</ForeName><Initials>O</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0003-0857-460X</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Chemical and Product Safety, German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR), Berlin, Germany.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>09</Month><Day>30</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>England</Country><MedlineTA>Food Addit Contam Part A Chem Anal Control Expo Risk Assess</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101485040</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1944-0057</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Element release</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">ICP-MS</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">food contact materials</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">lead crystal ware</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">metallic hip flasks</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">method validation</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>30</Day><Hour>12</Hour><Minute>47</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>30</Day><Hour>12</Hour><Minute>47</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>30</Day><Hour>11</Hour><Minute>43</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39348159</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1080/19440049.2024.2406002</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
