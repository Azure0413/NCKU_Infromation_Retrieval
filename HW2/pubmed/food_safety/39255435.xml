Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate adjusted mortality rate ratio (RR). The life table method was used to estimate life expectancy.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Among the 135,405 participants, 10.5% had diabetes and 36.2% had prediabetes in 2013. During a median follow-up of 6 years, 5517 deaths were recorded, including 1428 and 2300 deaths among people with diabetes and prediabetes, respectively. Diabetes and prediabetes were significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause (diabetes: RR, 1.61 [95% CI 1.49, 1.73]; prediabetes: RR, 1.08 [95% CI 1.01, 1.15]), and cardiovascular disease (diabetes: RR, 1.59 [95% CI 1.41, 1.78]; prediabetes: RR, 1.10 [95% CI 1.00, 1.21]) mortality. Additionally, diabetes was significantly associated with increased risks of death resulting from cancer, respiratory disease, liver disease, and diabetic ketoacidosis or coma. Compared with participants with normoglycemia, life expectancy of those with diabetes and prediabetes was shorter, on average, by 4.2 and 0.7 years at age 40 years, respectively. The magnitude of the associations of diabetes and prediabetes with all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality varied by age and residence.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">In this national study, diabetes and prediabetes were significantly associated with reduced life expectancy and increased all-cause and cause-specific mortality risks. The disparities in excess mortality associated with diabetes and prediabetes between different ages and residences have implications for diabetes and prediabetes prevention and treatment programs.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Tian</LastName><ForeName>Yunli</ForeName><Initials>Y</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Cardiovascular Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Clinical Center for Human Genomic Research, Union Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Qiu</LastName><ForeName>Zixin</ForeName><Initials>Z</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environment Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Wang</LastName><ForeName>Feixue</ForeName><Initials>F</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Deng</LastName><ForeName>Shan</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Cardiovascular Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Clinical Center for Human Genomic Research, Union Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Wang</LastName><ForeName>Yue</ForeName><Initials>Y</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Cardiovascular Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Clinical Center for Human Genomic Research, Union Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Wang</LastName><ForeName>Zi</ForeName><Initials>Z</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Liyuan Cardiovascular Center, Liyuan Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Hubei Prevention and Therapeutic Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Wuhan, Hubei, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Yin</LastName><ForeName>Peng</ForeName><Initials>P</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Huo</LastName><ForeName>Yong</ForeName><Initials>Y</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Cardiology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing 100034, China;
