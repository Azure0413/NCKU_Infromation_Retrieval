In order to effectively reduce the oxidation rate of camellia oil, prolong the shelf life in order to improve the stability in storage under different conditions, this study encapsulates camellia oil in Pickering emulsions stabilized by Octenyl succinic acid (OSA) starch, achieving a 100-fold reduction in release rate and enhanced lipid oxidation stability. The smooth surface and complete particles of the emulsion were observed and no new chemical bonds were formed. The minimum particle sizes were 1.72 μm and 2.73 μm, when the Pickering emulsion was set at pH 6 and 0.1 M NaCl. In the digestion process, the microstructures observed that Pickering emulsion possessed super stability against oral and gastric digestions, prolonged the release time and improved the bioavailability compared with camellia oil, and the digestibility of the emulsion was 56.16 % within 120 min. All these results indicate that OSA-starch stabilized camellia oil can effectively increase solubility, improve stability and expand the application range.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024.
