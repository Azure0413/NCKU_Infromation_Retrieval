There is a limited amount of research addressing female fertility assessed as ovarian reserve in relation to diet. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the association between dietary patterns and the parameters of ovarian reserve, such as antral follicle count (AFC), anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and estradiol (E2) - predictors of reproductive health in women of childbearing age.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="MATERIAL AND METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Women aged 24-39 years (N = 511) were enrolled from fertility clinic in central Poland. The count of antral follicles was determined using ultrasonography (USG), FSH and E2 levels were measured using a chemilumi- nescence method and for determination of AMH level, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method was employed. Diet was assessed according to food frequency questionnaire and dietary patterns were identified by factor analysis. Women were classified into 3 groups according to scores of each dietary pattern: Western, mixed, prudent.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Higher adherence to the prudent dietary pattern in obese women was associated with significantly higher AFC (p = 0.03) and AMH (p = 0.05) as compared to participants with the Western dietary pattern. The results were adjusted for age, BMI, smoking and duration of fertility. Increased consumption of mixed dietary pattern was not statistically significant associated with any of examined ovarian reserve parameters.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The prudent dietary pattern is positively associated with ovarian reserve in a cohort of women seeking fertility care. Continued research in this area will provide nutritional guidance for clinicians and their patients and provide novel insight on potential modifiable lifestyle factors which can be associated with ovarian reserve.
