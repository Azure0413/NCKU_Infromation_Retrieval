Coconut protein, a by-product derived from coconut oil and coconut milk cake, is frequently underutilized or discarded. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the distribution and composition of coconut protein. Analyses reveal that coconut protein, specifically 11S globulin and 7S globulin, is predominantly found in coconut flesh. Furthermore, various extraction techniques for coconut protein, such as chemical, enzymatic, and physical methods, are discussed. The alkali dissolution and acid precipitation methods are widely utilized for extracting coconut protein, with the potential for enhancement through the incorporation of physical methods such as ultrasound. The evaluation of functional properties, quality, and health benefits of coconut protein is essential, given the limitations imposed by its solubility. Modification may be necessary to optimize its functional properties. Coconut presents a promising source of food protein, characterized by balanced amino acid composition, high digestibility, and low allergenic potential. In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive overview of the extraction methods, functional properties, quality, and nutritional benefits of coconut protein, offering insights for potential future research directions in the field. Additionally, the information presented may serve as a valuable reference for incorporating coconut protein into plant-based food products.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2024 Elsevier B.V.
