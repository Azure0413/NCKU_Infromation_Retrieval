Food safety analysis is essential for ensuring food safety. Sulfur quantum dots (SQDs), a new type of zero-dimensional metal-free nanomaterials, have recently become the focus of scientific research due to their good luminescence properties, dispersibility, biocompatibility, and inherent antibacterial properties. This review focuses on recent advances in SQDs, with emphasis on their practical applications in the food field. First, commonly used methods for the synthesis of SQDs are presented, including traditional and emerging strategies. The properties of SQDs are then analyzed in detail, particularly their luminescence properties, catalytic activities, and reducing properties. Next, the use of SQDs in food safety detection and antibacterial fields are elaborated. Finally, this review discusses the challenges associated with the use of SQDs in food safety detection and antimicrobial applications.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
