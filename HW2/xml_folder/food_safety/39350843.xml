Due to the rarity of SBS as well as the recent timeline of the adoption of teduglutide, the safety of teduglutide is relatively poorly understood. Several recent clinical case reports have highlighted elevated pancreatic enzymes and pancreatitis as a concerning complication of teduglutide. This prompts a systematic study of the association between pancreatitis and teduglutide. Methods This study conducts a case-control design disproportionality analysis by using data from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Reports from the first quarter of 2020 through the first quarter of 2024 were retrieved from this database, and a disproportionality analysis was conducted. The analysis consisted of traditional methods of analyzing adverse drug events such as the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and proportional reporting ratio (PRR), as well as Bayesian methods such as the empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM) and information component (IC). A confidence interval for ROR and PRR that excludes a ratio of 1 or a confidence interval for IC that excludes a score of 0 was used as the criterion for a statistically significant association between pancreatitis risk and teduglutide use. Results Out of 11,696 reports of teduglutide adverse effects in over four years of adverse effects data drawn from the FAERS database, 79 cases of pancreatitis were identified. The disproportionality analysis revealed an ROR of 3.73 (95% CI (2.99, 4.66)), a PRR of 3.71 (95% CI (2.97, 4.63)), an EBGM of 3.70, and an IC of 1.84 (95% CI (1.51, 2.16)). All of these statistics indicate a statistically significant association between pancreatitis risk and teduglutide use. Conclusion The results reveal a statistically significant association between pancreatitis risk and teduglutide use. Our findings highlight the necessity for the careful monitoring of pancreatitis in patients undergoing teduglutide therapy going forward.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024, Gu et al.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Gu</LastName><ForeName>Joyce H</ForeName><Initials>JH</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Medicine, Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine, Greensburg, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Sheingold</LastName><ForeName>Zachary</ForeName><Initials>Z</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Internal Medicine, St. John's Riverside Hospital, Yonkers, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Samarneh</LastName><ForeName>Mark</ForeName><Initials>M</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Internal Medicine/Nephrology, Riverside Health System, Yonkers, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>08</Month><Day>29</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>Cureus</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101596737</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>2168-8184</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">disproportionality analysis</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">food and drug administration adverse event reporting system (faers)</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">medication-induced pancreatitis</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">pharmacovigilance</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">teduglutide</Keyword></KeywordList><CoiStatement>Human subjects: Consent was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
