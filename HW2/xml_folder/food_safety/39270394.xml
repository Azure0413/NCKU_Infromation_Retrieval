However, the effect of straw decomposition on Cr(VI) removal and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, Cr(VI) removal by pristine and decomposed rice/rape straws was investigated by batch experiments and a series of spectroscopies. The results showed that straw decomposition inhibited Cr(VI) removal, regardless of straw types. However, the potential mechanisms of the inhibition were distinct for the two straws. For the rice straw, a lower zeta potential after decomposition suppressed Cr(VI) sorption and subsequent reduction. In addition, less Cr(VI) was reduced by the decomposed rice straw-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) than the pristine one. In contrast, for the rape straw, due to the increased zeta potential after decomposition, the decreased Cr(VI) removal was mainly ascribed to less Cr(VI) reduction by the rape straw-derived DOM. These results emphasized the significant roles of straw surface potential and DOM in Cr(VI) removal, depending on straw types and decomposition, which facilitate the fundamental understanding of Cr(VI) removal by straws and are helpful for predicting the environmental risk of Cr and rational straw return in Cr(VI)-contaminated fields.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2024 Elsevier Inc.
