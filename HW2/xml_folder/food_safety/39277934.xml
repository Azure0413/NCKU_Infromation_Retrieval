Herein, we propose a novel colorimetric and photothermal dual-mode lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) based on plasmonic gold nanostars (AuNSs) for CBD detection in agricultural products. The AuNSs were synthesized via a rapid seed-mediated growth method (with growth time of ∼5 s). A stable immunoprobe was formed by adsorbing CBD antibodies onto AuNSs. This immunoprobe exhibited high conversion efficiency and sensitivity in photothermal detection with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.28 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>. The LOD of the colorimetric mode was higher (0.48 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>). The results of CBD detection in various agricultural products aligned well with ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Overall, our LFIA shows excellent sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, and rapidness in CBD detection, and thus is a highly potential on-site platform in resource-limited environments.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.
