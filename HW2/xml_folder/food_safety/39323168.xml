The enrichment characteristics of heavy metals in the soil-crop system of four soil-forming parent materials were compared and analyzed, and the influencing factors of Cd absorption by rice were studied. The comprehensive quality impact index method was used to evaluate the soil and crops in the study area, and the safe use of cultivated land was proposed according to the evaluation results. The results showed that in the four soil-forming parent material areas, only the carbonate rock parent material area showed obvious enrichment of heavy metals in the soil, especially Cd. According to the "National Food Safety Standard for the Limit of Pollutants in Food" （GB 2762-2022）, the excess rate of heavy metal Cd in rice seeds was 35.7%, and the other heavy metal rates were not exceeded. The bioconcentration coefficient of heavy metal Cd in rice from different parent material areas was as follows： quaternary sediment area &amp;gt; carbonate parent material area &amp;gt; clastic parent material area &amp;gt; granite parent material area. The enrichment of Cd in rice was affected by soil pH and CaO. When the soil pH value was in the range of 5.5-6.5, the Cd content and exceeding rate of rice seed increased significantly. The evaluation results of soil-crop heavy metal pollution showed that the overall heavy metal risk in the study area was high, and the proportions of clean, mild, light, moderate, and heavy pollution were 23.91%, 10.87%, 17.39%, 17.39%, and 30.43%, respectively. Combined with the distribution of the comprehensive quality influence index and the pollution characteristics of different parent materials, the classification and control suggestions were put forward, which provided ideas for the safe utilization of polluted cultivated land.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Li</LastName><ForeName>Zhao-Yi</ForeName><Initials>ZY</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>China-ASEAN Geoscience Cooperation Center (Nanning), Nanning 530022, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>College of Earth Sciences, Guilin University of Technology, Guilin 541006, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Zhao</LastName><ForeName>Han</ForeName><Initials>H</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>China-ASEAN Geoscience Cooperation Center (Nanning), Nanning 530022, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Li</LastName><ForeName>Wei</ForeName><Initials>W</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>China-ASEAN Geoscience Cooperation Center (Nanning), Nanning 530022, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Zhao</LastName><ForeName>Zi-Ning</ForeName><Initials>ZN</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>China-ASEAN Geoscience Cooperation Center (Nanning), Nanning 530022, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>chi</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D004740">English Abstract</PublicationType><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>China</Country><MedlineTA>Huan Jing Ke Xue</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>8405344</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>0250-3301</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">bioavailability</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">comprehensive quality impact index</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">parent material</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">risk management and control</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">soil heavy metals</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>26</Day><Hour>10</Hour><Minute>18</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>26</Day><Hour>10</Hour><Minute>17</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>26</Day><Hour>1</Hour><Minute>53</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>ppublish</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39323168</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.13227/j.hjkx.202308276</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
