Nitrite is a key antimicrobial additive that can offer some degree of protection against L. monocytogenes when included in meat product formulations. The objectives of this study were to determine the potential of nitrite-embedded film to affect the growth of L. monocytogenes following postthermal processing of conventionally-cured and nitrite-free bologna. Two bologna treatment formulations, a conventionally-cured control formulation (CON) and a nitrite-free formulation (UCC), were manufactured, packaged in conventional (CF) or nitrite-embedded (NEF) film, inoculated with 3.5 log CFU/cm<sup>2</sup> of a cocktail of L. monocytogenes strains, and stored at 10 ± 1 °C. CON-NEF and UCC-NEF treatments had significantly slower (P &lt; 0.05) growth of L. monocytogenes than CON-CF and UCC-CF, with populations in UCC-CF (which contained no nitrite) increasing by 3.4 logs after 10 d of storage in UCC-CF and 3.6 logs after 50 d in CON-CF (which had formulated nitrite only), while in the NEF-packaged samples, with or without formulated nitrite, they did not exceed the inoculum level until after day 40. Initial (day 0) residual nitrite was significantly greater (P &lt; 0.05) in the control formulation. Packaging in NEF, however, resulted in an increase of 27-28 ppm by day 3, regardless of formulation, after which it decreased rapidly. Results suggest NEF can be used as a post-lethality antimicrobial intervention in food safety intervention strategies, in both cured and uncured processed meat products.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).
