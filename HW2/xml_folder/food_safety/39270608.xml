The fluorescence-based visual determination of GSH has gradually attracted the attention of researchers due to its robust performance and versatile implementation. However, the current GSH visual strategy primarily relies on variations in fluorescence intensity at a single emission wavelength, which poses challenges for naked-eye and portable readout, as well as distorted signals caused by complex matrix effects in real samples. Herein, a ratiometric fluorescence sensor based on carbon dots (CDs) combined with an all-in-one 3D-printed smartphone-based device was successfully developed for low-cost, visual and rapid detection of GSH without the need for an external excitation light source. The ratiometric fluorescent materials were synthesized by conjugating blue carbon dots (B-CDs) with yellow carbon dots (Y-CDs) through the utilization of selected Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions. The resulting mechanism demonstrated that the coordination interaction between Cu<sup>2+</sup> and residual aromatic amino groups in Y-CDs (Y-CDs-Cu<sup>2+</sup>) contributed to a newly emitted peak at 580 nm, thereby inducing fluorescence resonance energy transfer from B-CDs to Y-CDs-Cu<sup>2+</sup>. A linear correlation was found between GSH concentrations and R/B values in the range of 10-100 μM, with a limit of detection observed at 4.8 μM. By utilizing this portable device in combination with RGB analysis, the quantitative detection of GSH can be achieved even in complex food matrices such as tomatoes and grapes. The universality of this all-in-one device was further validated by pre-spraying CDs onto a paper strip for visual measurement of GSH. This work offers a portable, visual, and accessible approach to evaluating food safety and nutrition, thereby demonstrating significant economic value and holding profound implications for human health.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.
