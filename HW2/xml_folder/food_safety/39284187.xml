Understanding recalls and their causes is important for patient safety.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVE" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To characterize Class I recalls of cardiovascular devices and the clinical evidence supporting authorization.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="DESIGN" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">In this cross-sectional study, cardiovascular device recalls from 1 January 2013 through 31 December 2022 were identified using the FDA's annual log. Information about devices was extracted from publicly available FDA decision summaries.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="SETTING" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The FDA Medical Device Recalls database.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="PARTICIPANTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Cardiovascular devices with Class I recalls.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="MEASUREMENTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Recalls were characterized by their causes and scope. Devices were characterized by their regulatory history (product code, special designations) and clinical evidence (premarket testing, postmarket surveillance). Clinical studies were analyzed for quality, including end point selection (clinical vs. surrogate, use of composites).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">From 2013 to 2022, there were 137 Class I recall events affecting 157 unique cardiovascular devices, of which 112 (71.3%) were moderate-risk 510(k) devices and 45 (28.7%) were high-risk premarket approval (PMA) devices. Recalls affected a median of 7649 units (IQR, 953 to 28â€‰446) and were most commonly attributed to device design (43 [31.4%]). Forty-two (26.8%) devices had multiple Class I recalls. Thirty (19.1%) devices underwent premarket clinical testing (7 [6.2%] 510(k) devices, 17 [85.0%] PMA devices, and 6 [24.0%] PMA supplement devices). Most studies used surrogate (27 [79.4%]) and composite (24 [70.6%]) measures as primary end points. Twenty-two (48.9%) PMA devices had required postapproval studies, with 14 reporting delays. No 510(k) devices were subject to postmarket surveillance.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="LIMITATION" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Details about clinical testing may be missing from FDA summaries.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Cardiovascular devices with Class I recalls were infrequently subjected to premarket or postmarket testing, with recalls affecting thousands of patients annually.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">None.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>See</LastName><ForeName>Claudia</ForeName><Initials>C</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0001-5331-4722</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California (C.S.).</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Mooghali</LastName><ForeName>Maryam</ForeName><Initials>M</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0001-9347-494X</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Section of General Medicine, Department of Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut (M.M.).</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Dhruva</LastName><ForeName>Sanket S</ForeName><Initials>SS</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0003-0674-2032</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Philip R.
