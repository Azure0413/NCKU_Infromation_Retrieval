To investigate the prevalence and genetic characteristics of RVs in China, we performed a molecular epidemiological study during 2017-2019 in community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in pediatric patients. In this multicenter study, 109 RV-A, 20 RV-B and 80 RV-C were identified. Among them, RV-A12, RV-A101, RV-A78, RV-A49, RV-A22, RV-B52, RV-C2, RV-C53 and RV-C5 were the common genotypes in the study. A total of 23 complete genome of RVs including 4 RV-A, 1 RV-B and 18 RV-C were obtained. Furthermore, in the RV-C isolates, one RV-C5 and five RV-C53 genotypes were found, which have a limited number in the GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome showed that most of the RVs isolated in the study have high nucleotide sequence identities (&gt;95%) compared with the corresponding reference sequence in the GenBank. In RV-A9, RV-A28, RV-A61 and RV-B52, amino acid mutations were found in the potential neutralizing immunogenic (Nim) sites (Nim-1a and Nim-1b) of the VP1. In RV-B52, one of RV-C2 and RV-C5 isolates, amino acid mutations were found in the P1a peptide of the VP1. However, no recombination events were found in the study. In conclusion, RV-A was the predominant specie of RVs followed by RV-C in the study. The complete genomes of one RV-C5 and five RV-C53 genotypes were obtained which have a limited number sequence in the GenBank. High nucleotide sequence identities (&gt;95%) were found among the complete genome obtained in the study and the corresponding reference sequence in the GenBank. Amino acid mutations were found in the potential Nim-1a, Nim-1b sites and P1a peptide region of the VP1 in parts of RVs.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2022 The Authors.
