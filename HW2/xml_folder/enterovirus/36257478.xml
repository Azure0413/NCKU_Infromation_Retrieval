These general EV-positive samples were identified by semi-nested RT-PCR method and sequencing. The CVA6 VP1 gene and genome sequences were amplified and sequenced. The phylogenetic, variation and recombination analyses were performed.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">A total of 1721 HFMD patients were enrolled in this study, with the male to female ratio of 1.62:1. The majority of cases were less than five years, which accounted for 73.50%. The overall detection rate of EV was 88.32% (1520/1721). A total of 8 EV types were identified, including CVA6 (55.86%), CVA16 (26.32%), EV-A71 (2.24%), CVA10 (2.04%), CVA4 (1.05%), CVA5 (0.59%), CVA2 (0.33%), and CVA8 (0.07%), while 175 (11.51%) EV were untyped. The main pathogen of HFMD was CVA6 from 2017 to 2018, while CVA6 and CVA16 were the main causative pathogens in 2019. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities of the 120 CVA6 complete VP1 gene sequences in this study were 91.2%-100.0% and 97.7%-100.0%, respectively. Compared with the prototype strain (Gdula) of CVA6, the nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities were 81.7%-84% and 94.7%-96.3%, respectively. The phylogenetic tree indicated that all 120 CVA6 sequences belonged to sub-genotype D3, while 119 CVA6 sequences belonged to evolutionary branch D3a, except one from 2017 belonged to D3b. Recombination analysis based on the complete genome sequences showed that potential multiple recombination may have occurred in 2B and 3D protein coding regions with EV-A114.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The main pathogens of HFMD were CVA6 and CVA16 in Beijing, China, 2017-2019; while these CVA6, as recombination strains, belonged to the D3a evolutionary branch.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2022 The Authors.
