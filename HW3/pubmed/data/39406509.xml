We used an interrupted time series design to examine feasibility by comparing attendance, monthly enrollment, and program completion between those who attended CTQ-R (July 2018-March 2020) versus CTQ-RV (April 2020-December 2022).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">There were 611 patients enrolled in tobacco cessation (N = 221 CTQ-R, N = 390 CTQ-RV). The average age was 59.4 years and most patients reported Black/African American race (81%) and female sex (69.5%). CTQ-RV proved feasible relative to CTQ-R, with higher rates of attendance (5.5 vs. 2.7 sessions, respectively), program completion (39.4% vs. 19%) and increased enrollment across each year (from 44.6 sessions per month in CTQ-R vs. 72.3 in CTQ-RV). CTQ-RV patients requested nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) at substantially higher rates (81.4%) than CTQ-R members (42.1%). Self-reported smoking abstinence at final session was higher in CTQ-RV compared with CTQ-R (33.3% vs. 15.7%). Within CTQ-RV, more than half (57%) of patients attended by video format, with outreach improving rates of video attendance each year.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Results show that a transition to virtual rolling enrollment smoking group treatment is feasible and can augment treatment outcomes, such as engagement, NRT use, and self-reported cessation.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© Society of Behavioral Medicine 2024.

The aim of the current investigation was to compare two rolling group treatment models, one in-person and one entirely remote, after the program transitioned modalities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcomes included feasibility, session attendance, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT use), and self-reported quitting. 611 patients were included in the study with an average age of 59.3 years and 81% were Black/African American. Compared with those who attended the in-person group, those in the remote-delivered, virtual group attended more sessions and were more likely to complete the program. Further, patients in the virtual group were more likely to request NRT and had higher rates of self-reported quitting. While more data is needed, specifically a randomized trial, to replicate and expand on these findings, these data suggest that transitioning an in-person rolling group smoking treatment to a fully remote delivery is not only feasible but also may augment engagement and smoking outcomes.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© Society of Behavioral Medicine 2024.
