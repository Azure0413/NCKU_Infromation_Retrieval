The assessment included a cognitive test battery and several questionnaires. The COVID-19 pandemic led to significant disruptions in recruitment and data collection, and the t-PA and conservative management groups were combined into a standard medical care (SMC) group.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Sixty-two participants were included in the study (ECR = 31, SMC = 31). Mean age was 66.5 (20-86) years, and 35 (56.5%) participants were male. Participants treated with ECR had significantly higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores at presentation and significantly lower education. After adjusting for stroke severity, premorbid intellectual ability, and age, treatment with ECR was associated with significantly better performances on measures of cognitive screening, visual working memory, and verbal learning and memory. Participants treated with ECR also experienced less fatigue and were more likely to achieve independence in basic and instrumental ADLs. Despite this, cognitive impairment and fatigue were still common among participants treated with ECR and anxiety and depression symptoms were experienced similarly by both groups.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Cognitive impairment and fatigue were less common but still prevalent following treatment with ECR. This has important practical implications for stroke rehabilitation, and routine assessment of cognition, emotion, and fatigue is recommended for all stroke survivors regardless of stroke treatment and functional outcome.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Humphrey</LastName><ForeName>Sam</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-0404-7047</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychology, Counselling &amp; Therapy, School of Psychology &amp; Public Health, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Neuropsychology Unit, Monash Medical Centre, Melbourne, Australia.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Pike</LastName><ForeName>Kerryn E</ForeName><Initials>KE</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychology, Counselling &amp; Therapy, School of Psychology &amp; Public Health, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>John Richards Centre for Rural Ageing Research, La Trobe University, Wodonga, Australia.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>School of Applied Psychology, Griffith Centre for Mental Health, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Long</LastName><ForeName>Brian</ForeName><Initials>B</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Neuropsychology Unit, Monash Medical Centre, Melbourne, Australia.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Neurosciences Unit, North Metropolitan Health Service, Perth, Australia.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Ma</LastName><ForeName>Henry</ForeName><Initials>H</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Neurology, Monash Medical Centre, Melbourne, Australia.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Bourke</LastName><ForeName>Robert</ForeName><Initials>R</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Neuropsychology Unit, Monash Medical Centre, Melbourne, Australia.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Wright</LastName><ForeName>Bradley J</ForeName><Initials>BJ</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychology, Counselling &amp; Therapy, School of Psychology &amp; Public Health, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Wong</LastName><ForeName>Dana</ForeName><Initials>D</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0001-9619-1929</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychology, Counselling &amp; Therapy, School of Psychology &amp; Public Health, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>16</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>England</Country><MedlineTA>J Int Neuropsychol Soc</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>9503760</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1355-6177</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Ischemic stroke</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">anxiety</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">cognition</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">depression</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">fatigue</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">thrombectomy</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>16</Day><Hour>10</Hour><Minute>19</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>16</Day><Hour>10</Hour><Minute>19</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>16</Day><Hour>3</Hour><Minute>13</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39410801</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1017/S1355617724000535</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="pii">S1355617724000535</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
