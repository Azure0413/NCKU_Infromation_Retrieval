Providing care can negatively impact children and young people's education, employment, health and social participation, with associated costs. Support is needed to prevent and reduce these negative impacts. The study sought to provide new knowledge and address prior research gaps regarding how best to support young carers from their perspective and that of the people they care for.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVES" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To address the following questions: What types, components or features of services and other support are seen as helpful, valued, and acceptable to young people who look after someone at home and the people they support? Conversely, what is found to be less or unhelpful? What additional support is perceived as needed? What are the barriers experienced by young and young adult carers in seeking and accessing services for themselves or the person they support? What are the barriers and facilitators for practitioners in providing support and services perceived as valued, helpful and needed by young and young adult carers and the people they support?</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="DESIGN AND SETTING" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">In-depth qualitative methodology using focus groups, in-depth semistructured interviews and workshops in four localities in England.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="PARTICIPANTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">One hundred and thirty-three carers aged 9-25 years with a range of caring and life circumstances and sociodemographic characteristics. Seventeen adult care recipients (parents) with a range of physical and/or mental healthcare and support needs. Nineteen practitioners from schools, colleges, young carers organisations, voluntary sector services, mental health services, the National Health Service, adult social care and local authority adult and children's social care commissioners.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The types and aspects of support that young carers and their families need, and value when received, include: support that reduces or removes their practical and emotional caring responsibilities; support to mitigate the negative impacts of care and help with other life issues; information and advice about services and wider resources and support; someone trusted available to talk to; greater awareness, recognition and understanding; and choice, flexibility, and co-development of plans and solutions. We found a great deal of unmet need for support, and variation in type and quality of support received, including geographically.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="LIMITATIONS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Potential limitations are that we were not able to engage with, or recruit, young carers from some intended subgroups, meaning some perspectives are missing. Partly because of COVID-19 measures during the study, we mainly recruited through young carers organisations and their family projects, although this was balanced by recruitment through schools and extensive outreach and engagement by the collaborating organisations prior to the project starting.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Action is now needed to consistently and sustainably implement the types of support that young carers and the people they care for say they need and value.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="FUTURE WORK" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Future work should include more research from the perspectives of young carers and the people they care for, especially from particularly marginalised groups; and research to understand what works and how to improve implementation of the support needed and valued.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="STUDY REGISTRATION" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">This study is registered as Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN13478876. https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN13478876.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="FUNDING" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">This award was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health and Social Care Delivery Research programme (NIHR award ref: NIHR129645) and is published in full in <i>Health and Social Care Delivery Research</i>; Vol. 12, No. 36.

They are sometimes called young or young adult carers. Providing care often brings satisfaction and a sense of pride but can also have negative effects on young people’s lives. The study aimed to find out their views about what would best support them and the people they care for. The study asked two important questions: (1) What are the difficulties faced by young carers and the people they support in seeking, accessing and receiving the right type of support at the right times? (2) What services and support do they find helpful, what support would they like, and what needs would it meet? To answer these questions, we held group discussions (focus groups) and in-depth interviews with 133 young carers with a range of caring and life circumstances and 17 parents receiving help from a young carer. We also held workshops with 19 practitioners who are involved in identifying, supporting and funding services for young carers and their families. They told us that the types of support that they and their families need, and value when received, include: support for the people they care for, so they are providing less practical and emotional care support to help with any negative impacts of providing care and with other life issues information and advice about services, wider resources and support someone trusted to talk to greater awareness, recognition and understanding choice, flexibility and working together to develop plans and solutions We found a great deal of unmet need for support, and variation in the type and quality of support received, including across geographical areas. Action is now needed to consistently and sustainably implement the types of support that young carers and their families say they need and value.</AbstractText></OtherAbstract><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">CARER SUPPORT</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">FOCUS GROUPS AND INTERVIEWS</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">MENTAL HEALTH</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">PARTICIPATION</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">PREVENTION</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">QUALITATIVE STUDY</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">SOCIAL CARE</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">UNMET NEEDS</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">UNPAID/INFORMAL CARE</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">YOUNG AND YOUNG ADULT CARERS</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>26</Day><Hour>12</Hour><Minute>45</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>26</Day><Hour>12</Hour><Minute>44</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>26</Day><Hour>8</Hour><Minute>53</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>ppublish</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39324762</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.3310/ABAT6761</ArticleId></ArticleIdList><ReferenceList><Reference><Citation>Leu A, Guggiari E, Phelps D, Magnusson L, Nap HH, Hoefman R, et al.
