This study sought to compare use of reproductive health services before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and analyze the types and quality of reproductive health-care services for patients who did and did not complete a telehealth visit.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Medical records were reviewed for AYA who sought reproductive health services at 9 urban family planning and school-based clinics. Visit-type differences and associated factors by year of service and among those who did and did not complete telehealth visits were analyzed.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Twenty-seven thousand nine hundred sixty-one unique patients were served between 2019 and 2021. As compared to 2019, in 2020 and 2021, there were significantly fewer visits by minors (&lt;18 years old) versus young adults (18-24 years old) (p &lt; .001), and by those with male versus female natal sex (p &lt; .001). At least one telehealth visit was completed by 17.98% of patients. Telehealth visit completion was more likely in young adults, female, Black, non-Hispanic, and higher-income patients. Telehealth users were more likely to complete annual sexually transmitted infection testing, had a higher number of visits per year, and had higher odds of requiring a return visit within 2 weeks of the index visit (odds ratio 1.5, 95% confidence intervals 1.41-1.76).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="DISCUSSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Our findings illustrate disparities in telehealth use in this population of economically disadvantaged AYA and provides pragmatic targets for future interventions.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.
