However, there was a significant decline in cancer screening during the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. This study aimed to measure regional differences in cancer screening by comparing screening rates before and during COVID-19 and to examine factors explaining the regional difference in cancer screening. All variables including the differences in cancer screening rate before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were collected from 229 administrative subregions in South Korea and joined with each community in ArcGIS environment. Factors explaining regional difference in cancer screening were analyzed through descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and interactive decision tree modeling. Cancer screening rates decreased in all regions during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea. The findings revealed that national health insurance premiums, the number of cancer screening facilities, livelihood benefit recipients, and the population aged 65+ could be classified as variables highly affecting the decrease in cancer screening rate. These findings highlight the efforts to appraise different barriers to cancer screening in each community. In addition, it is important to promote sustainable cancer screening strategies from regional perspectives based on regional vulnerabilities and their complex impact on cancer screening.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Park</LastName><ForeName>Jongho</ForeName><Initials>J</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Health and Medical Information, Daegu University, Gyeongsan-si, South Korea.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Kim</LastName><ForeName>Yeaeun</ForeName><Initials>Y</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-5075-2812</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Health Care Management, Catholic University of Pusan, Busan, South Korea.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Park</LastName><ForeName>Jae-Hyun</ForeName><Initials>JH</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0001-5860-7487</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Social and Preventive Medicine, School of Medicine, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>09</Month><Day>27</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>China</Country><MedlineTA>Asia Pac J Public Health</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>8708538</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1010-5395</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">COVID-19</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">cancer screening</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">decision trees</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">early detection of cancer</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">public health</Keyword></KeywordList><CoiStatement>Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</CoiStatement></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>28</Day><Hour>22</Hour><Minute>42</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>28</Day><Hour>22</Hour><Minute>42</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>28</Day><Hour>2</Hour><Minute>22</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39340176</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1177/10105395241282981</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
