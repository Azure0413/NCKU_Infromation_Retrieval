The study population included all patients with at least one qualifying RPM-related Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code for a neurological disorder, separated into first-generation (CPT 99091) codes and second-generation (CPT 99453, 99454, 99457, 99458) code cohorts. We compared patient and encounter characteristics between both cohorts. <b>Results</b>: We identified 27,756 encounters attributable to 11,326 patients who received RPM services for neurological disorders, of whom 5,785 (51.1%) received RPM via second-generation billing codes, 3,941 (34.8%) were female, 6,712 (59.3%) were between 45 and 64 years old, and 10,488 (92.6%) had a primary diagnosis of sleep-wake disorder. The second-generation cohort was significantly more likely to be female (41.5% vs. 27.8%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), be of age 65 or older (15.7% vs. 7.1%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and reside in urban areas (93.4% vs. 87.6%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) than the first-generation cohort. Patients in the second-generation cohort were more likely to receive RPM in office settings (86.3% vs. 62.5%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), by physicians (77.0% vs. 40.3%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and less likely for sleep-wake disorders (87.9% vs. 97.5%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) than the first-generation cohort. Patients who received RPM from physicians were most often evaluated by pulmonologists (31.4%). <b>Discussion</b>: In this commercially insured patient population receiving RPM for neurological disorders, we found that sleep-wake disorders and non-neurologists were over-represented.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Hwang</LastName><ForeName>Soonmyung</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0001-6240-106X</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Baron</LastName><ForeName>Rebecca</ForeName><Initials>R</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Saxena</LastName><ForeName>Vrinda</ForeName><Initials>V</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Agarwal</LastName><ForeName>Parul</ForeName><Initials>P</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Population Science and Health Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Institute for Health Care Delivery Science, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Kummer</LastName><ForeName>Benjamin</ForeName><Initials>B</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Clinical Neuro-Informatics Program, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Windreich Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Health, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>08</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>Telemed J E Health</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>100959949</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1530-5627</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">asynchronous</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">health informatics</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">medical informatics</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">neuro-informatics</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">telehealth</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">telemedicine</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">teleneurology</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>9</Day><Hour>4</Hour><Minute>50</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>9</Day><Hour>4</Hour><Minute>50</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>8</Day><Hour>20</Hour><Minute>12</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39379065</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1089/tmj.2024.0257</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
