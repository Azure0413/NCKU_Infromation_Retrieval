This study examined differences in perceived barriers and facilitators (such as values, beliefs, and concerns) to COVID-19 vaccine uptake and testing intention by vaccination status and testing hesitancy among rural Latino community members in Southwest Florida.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Rural Latino community members (<i>N</i> = 493) completed a cross-sectional survey in Spanish (86.0%) or English (14.0%) on perceived COVID-19 vaccine/testing barriers and facilitators, as well as demographics, mental health, medical history, health perceptions, and health literacy.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">At the time of the survey, approximately 43% of participants were unvaccinated and 46.4% were testing hesitant. Significantly more vaccinated participants acknowledged keeping their family (<i>d</i> = .25), community (<i>d</i> = .27), and themselves (<i>d</i> = .22) safe as facilitators to vaccination (ps &lt; .001). Among the unvaccinated participants, the most common concerns for getting vaccinated were side effects (<i>d</i> = -.53) and lack of knowledge about how the vaccine works (<i>d</i> = -.35, <i>p</i>s &lt; .001). Testing hesitant participants reported concerns including not knowing where to get tested (<i>d</i> = -.25, <i>p</i> = 0.01) and less confidence in a positive test result (<i>d</i> = -.40, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Doctors and faith leaders were ranked as the most trusted information sources across groups. In logistic regression models, vaccination was linked to age, gender, education, and protecting others, while concerns about needles and side effects reduced odds; testing was driven by education, anxiety, hope, and safety concerns.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Promoting family and community safety may be effective facilitators influencing vaccine and testing intention in rural Latino communities. Enhanced education by trusted information sources, such as doctors and faith leaders may alleviate associated concerns. Our findings may inform actions for future pandemics. Further studies should determine the generalizability of our findings across other rural migrant communities and other vaccines.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Redwine</LastName><ForeName>Laura</ForeName><Initials>L</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Buro</LastName><ForeName>Acadia W</ForeName><Initials>AW</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>College of Population Health, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Rancourt</LastName><ForeName>Diana</ForeName><Initials>D</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychology, University of South Florida, Tampa, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Conner</LastName><ForeName>Kyaien</ForeName><Initials>K</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Mental Health Law and Policy, College of Behavioral and Community Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa,USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Gray</LastName><ForeName>Heewon L</ForeName><Initials>HL</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>College of Public Health, University of South Florida, Tampa, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Rodriguez</LastName><ForeName>Carmen</ForeName><Initials>C</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>College of Nursing, University of South Florida, Tampa, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Bailey</LastName><ForeName>Rocio</ForeName><Initials>R</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Hispanic Services Council, Tampa, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Roman Candelaria</LastName><ForeName>Kevin</ForeName><Initials>K</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Child and Family Studies, College of Behavioral and Community Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Stern</LastName><ForeName>Marilyn</ForeName><Initials>M</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Child and Family Studies, College of Behavioral and Community Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Health Outcomes and Behavior, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>12</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>England</Country><MedlineTA>Ethn Health</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>9608374</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1355-7858</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">COVID-19</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Latino</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">SDG 10: Reduced inequalities</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">SDG 3: Good health and well-being</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">pandemic response</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">rural</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>13</Day><Hour>4</Hour><Minute>18</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>13</Day><Hour>4</Hour><Minute>18</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>12</Day><Hour>21</Hour><Minute>53</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39395891</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1080/13557858.2024.2412850</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
