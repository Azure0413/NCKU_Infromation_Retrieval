Wearing masks has become a routine behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. The level of respirational exposure and the influence of wearing masks are currently unknown. We recruited 113 college students and divided them into natural exposure (NE), surgical mask (SM), and cotton mask (CM) groups. Nasal lavage fluid (NLF) was collected and MPs characteristics were analyzed using polarized light microscopy and laser direct infrared system. We found a relatively high abundance of MPs in NLF in the SM group (41.24 ± 1.73 particles/g). The particle size distribution and fibrous MP percentage significantly differed among the three groups. The main components in the NE, SM, and CM groups were polypropylene (58.70 %)，polycarbonate (PC, 49.49 %)，and PC (54.29 %). Components such as polyamide, polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate were also detected. Wearing surgical masks increased the MP abundance in NLF (β = 0.36, P &lt; 0.01). As the wear time increased, the abundance of MPs also rose (β = 0.28, P &lt; 0.05). However, those who used bedding containing synthetic fibers had lower MP abundance in their NLF. This study highlights the use of NLF to evaluate MP exposure, which is associated with potential health risks.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024 The Authors.
