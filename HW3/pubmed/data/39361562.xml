However, the obstacles they faced and their resilience strategies have received insufficient research attention. This study, focusing on 13 residential care homes in Southeast China, addressed this research gap. The homes were visited between February and March 2023; 38 staff members (managers, nurses, social workers, and care workers) were interviewed. Thematic analysis revealed that the homes faced multidimensional challenges, including infection risks, declining mental health among residents, heavy workloads, and financial difficulties. Despite these challenges, they exhibited organizational resilience, primarily in their ability to cope with immediate issues during the pandemic, although their capacity to anticipate and adapt was weak. Factors influencing organizational resilience included their knowledge base, critical resources, a stable team with high morale and motivation, better integration of healthcare services, and government anti-COVID policies. This research highlights valuable insights for improving the quality of care in residential care homes in the post-pandemic era and in aiding policymakers and administrators in strengthening the organizational resilience of residential care homes in future crises.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Lu</LastName><ForeName>Shiyu</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-9355-4883</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Social Work and Social Administration, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Chan</LastName><ForeName>Wing Kit</ForeName><Initials>WK</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-3154-7143</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Chinese Center for Public Administration Research/School of Government, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>03</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>England</Country><MedlineTA>J Aging Soc Policy</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>8914669</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>0895-9420</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">COVID-19</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">long-term care for older people</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">organizational resilience</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>4</Day><Hour>7</Hour><Minute>19</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>4</Day><Hour>7</Hour><Minute>19</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>3</Day><Hour>13</Hour><Minute>33</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39361562</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1080/08959420.2024.2403828</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
