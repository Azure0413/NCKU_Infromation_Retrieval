It also explores the trends in telehealth provision by physicians' age, gender, and by state policies on telehealth payment parity. <b>Methods</b>: Aggregated, de-identified data derived from medical claims containing 450,588 physician-quarter observations during 2020 to 2022 were analyzed using descriptive methods to examine the total number of telehealth services to pregnant individuals provided, the number of obstetrician-gynecologists that provided telehealth, and the mean number of telehealth services provided per quarter. <b>Results</b>: Obstetrician-gynecologists' telehealth provision increased rapidly after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching its peak during the winter 2020 wave (fourth quarter) during which 4,663 obstetrician-gynecologists provided 13,846 telehealth visits. This was followed by a drop in subsequent quarters and during the fourth quarter of 2022, about 9,500 visits were provided by 2,800 obstetrician-gynecologists. Mean number of telehealth visits per physician was higher among older obstetrician-gynecologists and among those that practiced in states that adapted telehealth payment parity policies. <b>Conclusions</b>: Physician sex, age, and the state of practice location impacted their telehealth provision during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future policies aimed at ensuring telehealth access for pregnant people should consider these factors.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Bodas</LastName><ForeName>Mandar</ForeName><Initials>M</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-4334-3308</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Health Policy and Management, Fitzhugh Mullan Institute for Health Workforce Equity, Milken Institute School of Public Health, George Washington University, Washington, District of Columbia, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Park</LastName><ForeName>Yoon Hong</ForeName><Initials>YH</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Health Policy and Management, Fitzhugh Mullan Institute for Health Workforce Equity, Milken Institute School of Public Health, George Washington University, Washington, District of Columbia, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Luo</LastName><ForeName>Qian</ForeName><Initials>Q</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Health Policy and Management, Fitzhugh Mullan Institute for Health Workforce Equity, Milken Institute School of Public Health, George Washington University, Washington, District of Columbia, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Erikson</LastName><ForeName>Clese</ForeName><Initials>C</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Health Policy and Management, Fitzhugh Mullan Institute for Health Workforce Equity, Milken Institute School of Public Health, George Washington University, Washington, District of Columbia, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Vichare</LastName><ForeName>Anushree</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Health Policy and Management, Fitzhugh Mullan Institute for Health Workforce Equity, Milken Institute School of Public Health, George Washington University, Washington, District of Columbia, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>14</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>Telemed J E Health</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>100959949</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1530-5627</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">COVID-19</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">health workforce</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">prenatal care</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">private insurance</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">telehealth</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">telehealth payment parity</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">telemedicine</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>14</Day><Hour>10</Hour><Minute>17</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>14</Day><Hour>10</Hour><Minute>17</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>14</Day><Hour>4</Hour><Minute>23</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39397567</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1089/tmj.2024.0391</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
