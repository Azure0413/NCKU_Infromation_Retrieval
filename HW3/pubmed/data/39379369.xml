Recent studies investigated the immune resistance of SARS-CoV-2 JN.1 but additional factors are speculated to contribute to its global dominance, which remain elusive until today. Here, we find that SARS-CoV-2 JN.1 has a higher infectivity than BA.2.86 in differentiated primary human nasal epithelial cells (hNECs). Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the gained infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 JN.1 over BA.2.86 associates with increased entry efficiency conferred by L455S and better spike cleavage in hNECs. Structurally, S455 altered the mode of binding of JN.1 spike protein to ACE2 when compared to BA.2.86 spike at ACE2<sup>H34</sup>, and modified the internal structure of JN.1 spike protein by increasing the number of hydrogen bonds with neighboring residues. These findings indicate that a single mutation (L455S) enhances virus entry in hNECs and increases immune evasiveness, which contribute to the robust transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 JN.1. We further evaluate the in vitro and in vivo virological characteristics between SARS-CoV-2 BA.2.86/JN.1 and EG.5.1/HK.3, and identify key lineage-specific features of the two Omicron sublineages that contribute to our understanding on Omicron antigenicity, transmissibility, and pathogenicity.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© 2024.
