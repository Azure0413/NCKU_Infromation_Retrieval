Dose measurements were recorded for 94 radiology personnel: radiographers, NM technicians, physicians, and nurses. In addition to descriptive statistics, the Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare the average annual effective dose between male and female workers and between the periods before and during COVID-19. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare effective radiation doses from different quadrants.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The annual average effective doses were found to be between 0.58 and 0.72 mSv for males and 0.68 and 0.85 mSv for females. All radiographers, 86% of nurses, and 69% of physicians have received annual average effective doses below 0.99 mSv. The average annual effective doses for all radiation workers were similar in the period before COVID-19 when compared to the period during COVID-19 except for nurses who had significantly lower (P&lt;0.05) doses before COVID-19.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The average annual effective doses of radiation workers during 2018-2022 were well below the annual dose limit. A relatively higher average effective dose was received among NM technicians compared with other radiation occupational workers. While the caseload during the COVID-19 pandemic was lower due to government policies, the radiation dose to healthcare workers during the pandemic was similar to that before the pandemic.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2024 The Royal College of Radiologists.
