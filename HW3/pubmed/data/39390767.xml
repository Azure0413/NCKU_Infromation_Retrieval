We compared the effect measure (relative risk) of composite outcomes and that of its most critical component (i.e. death) by estimating the Bias Attributable to Composite Outcomes index [ln(relative risk for the composite outcome)/ln(relative risk for death)].</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Composite endpoints accounted for 152 out of 417 primary endpoints in coronavirus disease 2019 randomized trials, being more frequent among studies published in high-impact journals. Ordinal endpoints were the most common (54% of all composites), followed by binary or time-to-event (34%), numerical (11%), and hierarchical (1%). Composites predominated among trials enrolling patients with severe disease when compared to trials with a mild or moderate case mix (odds ratio = 1.72). Adaptations of the seven-point World Health Organization scale occurred in 40% of the ordinal primary endpoints, which frequently underwent dichotomization for the statistical analyses. Mortality accounted for a median of 24% (interquartile range: 6%-48%) of all events when included in the composite. The median point estimate of the Bias Attributable to Composite Outcomes index was 0.3 (interquartile range: -0.1 to 0.7), being significantly lower than 1 in 5 of 24 comparisons.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="DISCUSSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Composite endpoints were used in a significant proportion of coronavirus disease 2019 trials, especially those involving severely ill patients. This is likely due to the higher anticipated rates of competing events, such as death, in such studies. Ordinal composites were common but often not fully appreciated, reducing the potential gains in information and statistical efficiency. For studies with binary composites, death was the most frequent component, and, unexpectedly, composite outcome estimates were often closer to the null when compared to those for mortality death. Numerical composites were less common, and only two trials used hierarchical endpoints. These newer approaches may offer advantages over traditional binary and ordinal composites; however, their potential benefits warrant further scrutiny.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Composite endpoints accounted for more than a third of coronavirus disease 2019 trials' primary endpoints; their use was more common among studies that included patients with severe disease and their point effect estimates tended to underestimate those for mortality.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Martins</LastName><ForeName>Pedro Nascimento</ForeName><Initials>PN</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-5760-6869</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Federal University of Juiz de Fora, Juiz de Fora, Brazil.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Lourenço</LastName><ForeName>Mateus Henrique Toledo</ForeName><Initials>MHT</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Federal University of Juiz de Fora, Juiz de Fora, Brazil.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Mota</LastName><ForeName>Gabriel Paz Souza</ForeName><Initials>GPS</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Federal University of Juiz de Fora, Juiz de Fora, Brazil.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Cavalcanti</LastName><ForeName>Alexandre Biasi</ForeName><Initials>AB</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>HCor Research Institute, São Paulo, Brazil.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Peçanha Antonio</LastName><ForeName>Ana Carolina</ForeName><Initials>AC</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0001-6146-1247</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Diaz-Quijano</LastName><ForeName>Fredi Alexander</ForeName><Initials>FA</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType><PublicationType UI="D016454">Review</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>10</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>England</Country><MedlineTA>Clin Trials</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101197451</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1740-7745</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Composite endpoints</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">competing risks</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">endpoint selection</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">outcome measures</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">randomized controlled trials</Keyword></KeywordList><CoiStatement>Declaration of conflicting interestsThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</CoiStatement></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>11</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>23</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>11</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>23</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>11</Day><Hour>1</Hour><Minute>53</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39390767</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1177/17407745241276130</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
