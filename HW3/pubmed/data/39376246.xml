Given the increased risk of severe viral pneumonia in pregnant women, it is critical to foster confidence in the vaccine's safety and understand any potential adverse events (AEs). So, we did this study in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (SA), from March to May 2022 to compare women who did not get any doses of the COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy (Group A) to women who did get at least one dose during pregnancy (Group B) regarding (1) the frequency, types, AEs, and management of its AEs of the COVID-19 vaccination; and (2) exploring pregnancy, delivery, and fetus-related complications (e.g., miscarriage, birth defects, and preterm labor).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A cross-sectional study targeted 438 women who gave birth or were pregnant within the previous 8 weeks. Data was collected through face-to-face interviews with skilled nurses in 13 randomly selected primary healthcare facilities, using a validated, well-structured questionnaire that included the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) COVID-19 vaccination-related AEs. We analyzed the collected data using SPSS version 27.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Most participants were aged 25 to less than 35 (58.8%), and 287 (61.3%) were university graduates. There was no statistically significant difference among the studied groups regarding demographics. However, women in Group B had a significantly higher rate of abortions, oligohydramnios (24.4%), abnormal placentas (size and location), 103 (42.7%) abnormal fetal growth, 122 (53.7%) problems breastfeeding, blood pressure problems, and more cases of malaise, headaches, chest pain, breathing problems, and sleep problems than women in Group A. After the second and third doses, the confirmed post-vaccination COVID-19 rates in Group B were lower than those in Group A.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The COVID-19 vaccine significantly reduces post-vaccination COVID-19. Although COVID-19 vaccine-related AES are prevalent, analgesics and antipyretics effectively treat most of them.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s), 2024.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Amer</LastName><ForeName>Ahmed A</ForeName><Initials>AA</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Amer</LastName><ForeName>Samar A</ForeName><Initials>SA</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Community, Environmental and Occupational Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Badokhon</LastName><ForeName>Amerah</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Administration of Health Awareness, Ministry of Health Jeddah, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Hammad</LastName><ForeName>Sherif M</ForeName><Initials>SM</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Faculty of Medicine, Beni Suef University, Beni Suef, Egypt.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Wasfy</LastName><ForeName>Mohamed A</ForeName><Initials>MA</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Khan</LastName><ForeName>Misha</ForeName><Initials>M</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Medicine and Surgery, Liaquat National Hospital and Medical College, Karachi, Pakistan.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Ateyah Al-Harbi</LastName><ForeName>Tahani</ForeName><Initials>T</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Clinical Health Education, Administration of Health Awareness, Ministry of Health, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Alobaid</LastName><ForeName>Sadah Qamous</ForeName><Initials>SQ</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Clinical Health Education, Administration of Health Awareness, Ministry of Health, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Eskander</LastName><ForeName>Georgette</ForeName><Initials>G</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Abdel-Azeem</LastName><ForeName>Amro</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0001-8607-1536</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Population Health Management and Research, Riyadh First Health Cluster, Ministry of Health, Riyadh 11564, Saudi Arabia.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Community, Environmental and Occupational Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Alshowair</LastName><ForeName>Abdulmajeed</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>VP Community Health Excellence, Riyadh First Health Cluster Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Ramadan</LastName><ForeName>Mohamed Sh</ForeName><Initials>MS</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>05</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>England</Country><MedlineTA>Ther Adv Vaccines Immunother</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101718382</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>2515-1355</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><OtherAbstract Type="plain-language-summary" Language="eng"><AbstractText Label="UNLABELLED">Prevalence and issues of COVID-19 vaccine adverse events among pregnant women.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Clear and trustworthy information is essential for increasing public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccinations, particularly among pregnant women who face higher risks of severe illness.
