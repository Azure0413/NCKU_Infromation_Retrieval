Yet, their wide-scale adoption and commercial viability are limited due to low yields and relatively lengthy preparations of current methods. We report the novel application of protein-functionalised magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to enable the rapid mass production of nanoMIPs for protein recognition. An aldehyde-functionalised MNP (MNP@CHO) precursor was synthesised using a one-pot microwave method in less than 20 minutes, resulting in 330 mg yield for a 30 mL reaction volume. The MNP@CHO precursor (10 mg) was subsequently functionalised with 600 μg of a target template protein, giving MNP@protein. In the presence of an <i>N</i>-hydroxymethylacrylamide (NHMA) functional monomer and <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>'-methylene bisacrylamide as a crosslinker, the MNP@protein particles served as nucleants for the mass production of nanoMIPs in a 20-30 minute synthesis process. Subsequently, the nanoMIPs could be harvested with sonication and then retrieved using a magnet, leaving the MNP@protein particles to be recycled and re-used at least 5 times for further nanoMIP production cycles. In general, 10 mg of MNP@protein produced 10 mg of nanoMIP with a 20% decrease in the yield over the 5 synthesis cycles. For the bovine haemoglobin nanoMIP, the <i>K</i><sub>D</sub> was determined to be 3.47 × 10<sup>-11</sup> M, a binding affinity rivalling values found for monoclonal antibodies. We also demonstrate that the methodology is generic by producing high-affinity nanoMIPs for other proteins including albumin, lysozyme and SARS-CoV-2 recombinant protein. We therefore present a facile route to produce nanoMIPs in large industrially relevant quantities (hundreds of mg) and at short timescales (within a day). Our method offers realistic opportunities for the industry to adopt such materials as an antibody replacement technology in diagnostics, biological extraction and therapeutics.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Reddy</LastName><ForeName>Subrayal M</ForeName><Initials>SM</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-7362-184X</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Chemistry, Institute of Materials and Investigative Sciences, UCLan Centre for Smart Materials, School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Lancashire, Preston, PR1 2HE, UK. smreddy@uclan.ac.uk.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Stephen</LastName><ForeName>Andrei N</ForeName><Initials>AN</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Chemistry, Institute of Materials and Investigative Sciences, UCLan Centre for Smart Materials, School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Lancashire, Preston, PR1 2HE, UK. smreddy@uclan.ac.uk.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Holden</LastName><ForeName>Mark A</ForeName><Initials>MA</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Chemistry, Institute of Materials and Investigative Sciences, UCLan Centre for Smart Materials, School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Lancashire, Preston, PR1 2HE, UK. smreddy@uclan.ac.uk.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Stockburn</LastName><ForeName>William J</ForeName><Initials>WJ</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Chemistry, Institute of Materials and Investigative Sciences, UCLan Centre for Smart Materials, School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Lancashire, Preston, PR1 2HE, UK. smreddy@uclan.ac.uk.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Dennison</LastName><ForeName>Sarah R</ForeName><Initials>SR</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0003-4863-9607</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Chemistry, Institute of Materials and Investigative Sciences, UCLan Centre for Smart Materials, School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Lancashire, Preston, PR1 2HE, UK. smreddy@uclan.ac.uk.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>18</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>England</Country><MedlineTA>Biomater Sci</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101593571</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>2047-4830</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>18</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>23</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>18</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>23</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>18</Day><Hour>3</Hour><Minute>53</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39420810</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1039/d4bm00990h</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
