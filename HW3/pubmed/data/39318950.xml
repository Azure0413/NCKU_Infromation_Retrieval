Despite the availability of effective vaccines, vaccination uptake remains varied across different regions and populations. This study aims to investigate the factors influencing COVID-19 vaccination uptake in South Indian districts, with a focus on understanding public perceptions. Utilizing a cross-sectional survey methodology, data were collected from a representative sample of residents in selected South Indian districts. The survey explored a range of variables including demographic characteristics, knowledge and awareness about COVID-19 vaccines, perceived risks and benefits, trust in healthcare systems, and sources of vaccine-related information. The preliminary analysis indicates that vaccine uptake is significantly influenced by factors such as age, educational level, and socioeconomic status. High levels of vaccine hesitancy were associated with misinformation, concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy, and distrust in government and healthcare authorities. Conversely, individuals with higher education levels and those who received accurate information from trusted sources showed a greater willingness to get vaccinated. Social and cultural beliefs also played a crucial role in influencing vaccination attitudes, stressing the need for the importance of culturally sensitive health communication strategies. The study investigates a range of factors, including demographic characteristics such as age, gender, education level, and socio-economic status, as well as psychological and social determinants like the perceived risk of COVID-19, trust in vaccines, and the influence of misinformation. This study underscores the need for targeted public health interventions to address vaccine hesitancy and improve vaccination rates in South India. By identifying the key factors influencing vaccination decisions, policymakers and healthcare providers can develop more effective communication and outreach programs tailored to the unique needs and concerns of the population. Enhanced efforts in education, transparency, and community engagement are essential to fostering greater public trust and achieving higher vaccination coverage.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024, B et al.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>B</LastName><ForeName>Raghav</ForeName><Initials>R</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Medicine and Surgery, PSG Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Coimbatore, IND.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Rajagopal</LastName><ForeName>Jayakumar</ForeName><Initials>J</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Respiratory Medicine, PSG Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Coimbatore, IND.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Ramaraju</LastName><ForeName>Karthikeyan</ForeName><Initials>K</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Respiratory Medicine, PSG Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Coimbatore, IND.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>08</Month><Day>24</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>Cureus</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101596737</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>2168-8184</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">covid-19 vaccination uptake</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">health communication</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">public perceptions</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">south indian districts</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">vaccine hesitancy</Keyword></KeywordList><CoiStatement>Human subjects: Consent was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
