The participants answered an online questionnaire through their electronic devices. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to analyze the data.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A total of 500 pregnant women participated in this study. Among them, 67.4% and 81.4% had great knowledge and a positive attitude toward the COVID-19 vaccine, respectively, with scores of 80% or higher in each section. Of the 500 participants, 468 (93.6%) accepted to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. After adjusting for certain variables through multivariate analysis, the factor associated with the decision to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was having great knowledge about the vaccine (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 13.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.45-71.61). However, the most significant factor associated with the decision to reject the COVID-19 vaccine was the recent COVID-19 infection (adjusted OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.02-0.62).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The COVID-19 pandemic presents severe and life-threatening conditions for both pregnant women and their fetuses. The majority of the pregnant women in this study had great knowledge and acceptance of the vaccine and a positive attitude toward it. The pregnant women who had prior knowledge of the vaccine tended to accept to receive it during pregnancy, whereas those who recently contracted COVID-19 were hesitant to receive the vaccine.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s), 2024.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Kuptarak</LastName><ForeName>Arissara</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Pathumwan, Bangkok, Thailand.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Phupong</LastName><ForeName>Vorapong</ForeName><Initials>V</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0003-0151-9595</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Placental Related Diseases Research Unit, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Rama IV Road, Pathumwan, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>09</Month><Day>21</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>England</Country><MedlineTA>Ther Adv Vaccines Immunother</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101718382</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>2515-1355</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><OtherAbstract Type="plain-language-summary" Language="eng"><AbstractText>Knowledge, attitude and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine in pregnant women Due to the COVID-19 situation, vaccination is a key factor in reducing the severity and transmission of the disease, especially in the vulnerable population, which includes pregnant women.
