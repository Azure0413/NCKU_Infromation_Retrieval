We performed open surgical tracheostomy (OST), conventional percutaneous tracheostomy (CPT), and novel percutaneous tracheostomy (NPT), a modification of CPT designed to reduce contamination spread, in pig models and then compared the degree of contamination to providers using Glo Germ (Glo Germ, Moab, UT, USA).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN" NlmCategory="METHODS">Six Yorkshire pigs were used for data collection. Either OST, CPT or NPT was performed on the pigs by the same team including a surgeon, anesthesiologist, and respiratory therapist. A mixture of Glo Germ and water was administered via atomizer into the oral cavity to the tracheal bifurcation before each procedure, and additionally dispersed via an aersolizer in the trachea and lungs through the endotracheal tube before and throughout the procedure. Before and immediately after each procedure, pre-specified body parts of the providers were photographed and two independent examiners blindly evaluated the photographs to determine degree of Glo Germ contamination using a 3-point Likert scale.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Total contamination among provider team average score (min. 0, max. 2), was significantly lower for OST than CPT (0.29 ± 0.59 vs 0.63 ± 0.65; P&lt;0.01) or NPT (0.29 ± 0.59 vs 0.59 ± 0.66; p &lt;0.01). No significant difference was seen in overall contamination of any provider between CPT and NPT (0.63 ± 0.65 vs 0.59 ± 0.66; p =0.92).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Our results suggest that OST causes significantly less aerosol contamination to providers than either CPT or NPT.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024 by the American College of Surgeons.
