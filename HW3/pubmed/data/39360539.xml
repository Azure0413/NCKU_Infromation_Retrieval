Published articles up to September 2022 were included. The Glucose Monitoring Index (GMI) and HbA1c level were defined as outcome variables. Average glucose level was found to be a common variable in both HbA1c levels and GMI; therefore, HbA1c and GMI were converted to average glucose (mg/dL) using appropriate formulas. Studies reported the outcomes in two or three periods (pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-lockdown) were included in the analysis. A paired wise meta-analysis was performed among the studies that reported all three periods. Homogeneity across studies was assessed using I2 statistic.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULT" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Fourteen studies were included in the study. The pooled average glucose during the lockdown decreased to 166.9 mg/dL (95% CI, 153.78, 180.02) from 205.793 mg/dL (95% CI, 188.412, 223.173) during the pre-lockdown period, then it increased to 204.23 mg/dL (95% CI, 186.17, 222.29) during the post-lockdown period. A paired wise meta-analysis indicated a reduction in average glucose levels. However, it was not statistically significant, possibly due to the small number of studies that reported data from all three periods.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Although the descriptive analysis of our study showed that the lockdown had affected (decreased) the average glucose level among adolescents with type 1 diabetes, this was not statistically significant in the pooled analysis.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers;
