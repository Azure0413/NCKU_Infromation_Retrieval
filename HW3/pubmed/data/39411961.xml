Our objective was to determine the distribution of ACE and ACE2 receptor phenotypes by patient demographics and correlate ACE and ACE2 levels of activity with SARS-CoV-2 outcomes.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Hypertensive patients treated for SARS-CoV-2 at an urban emergency department (ED) were prospectively enrolled in a cohort study between August 2020 and April 2021. Blood samples were collected during ED visits or hospitalization. Outcome measures including hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and 30-day mortality were obtained from electronic health records. Multivariable logistic regression was used.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Of the 150 patients enrolled, 60% were Black, 32% Hispanic/Latinx, 4% Non-Hispanic Whites, and 4% others. The mean age was 59 (+/-14) years. The rate of hospitalization was high (86%) and Hispanic/Latinx had a higher likelihood of ICU admission. Patients harboring the rs2285666 genotype TT, AA, and GC alleles were more likely to be admitted to ICU, and those with TT and AA had higher mortality. The ACE level was a significant predictor of hospitalization with a protective effect in both unadjusted and adjusted results. Hispanics/Latinx had a four times higher likelihood of ICU admission compared to all others, and age was significantly associated with 30-day mortality.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Our results show that even after adjusting for age, race, and sex, ACE levels remained a predictor of hospitalization. ACE/ACE2 phenotypes and genotypes potentially play an important role in disease progression in SARS-CoV-2 patients.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Prendergast</LastName><ForeName>Heather M</ForeName><Initials>HM</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Kotini-Shah</LastName><ForeName>Pavitra</ForeName><Initials>P</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Pobee</LastName><ForeName>Ruth</ForeName><Initials>R</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Richardson</LastName><ForeName>Maxwell</ForeName><Initials>M</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>School of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Ardati</LastName><ForeName>Amer</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Darbar</LastName><ForeName>Dawood</ForeName><Initials>D</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Khosla</LastName><ForeName>Shaveta</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>15</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United Arab Emirates</Country><MedlineTA>Curr Hypertens Rev</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101239891</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1573-4021</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">ACE</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">ACE2</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">COVID-19</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">emergency department</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">hospitalization.</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">hypertension</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="received"><Year>2024</Year><Month>3</Month><Day>11</Day></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="revised"><Year>2024</Year><Month>8</Month><Day>28</Day></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="accepted"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>6</Day></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>16</Day><Hour>12</Hour><Minute>24</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>16</Day><Hour>12</Hour><Minute>24</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>16</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>13</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39411961</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.2174/0115734021315730240919062555</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="pii">CHYR-EPUB-143898</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
