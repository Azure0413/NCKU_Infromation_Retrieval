On January 26, 2021, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) staff began daily audits of documents of arriving passengers at 18 US international ports of entry to ensure documentation of either a negative predeparture antigen or nucleic acid amplification test result for SARS-CoV-2 or recent recovery from COVID-19. This case study briefly describes the results of those audits. The CDC found a very low rate of issues overall. Of the 483,251 passengers selected for audit, 2,142 (0.44%) had issues with their COVID-19 test documentation and 1,182 (0.24%) provided documentation of recovery from COVID-19 rather than a negative test result. The low rate of issues noted during traveler audits indicated airlines were largely compliant with the order. However, the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infections within the United States was high during much of this period, which suggests that implementing a predeparture testing requirement earlier in the pandemic might have had more impact on spread. Digital solutions could reduce the burden of similar interventions in the future on airlines, public health authorities, and other partners.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Preston</LastName><ForeName>Leigh Ellyn</ForeName><Initials>LE</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Leigh Ellyn Preston, DrPH, MPH, and Deborah Christensen, PhD, RN, are Epidemiologists; Andre Berro, MPH, is a Health Scientist; Bukunmi Gesinde, MSPH, EdD, is a Quality Assurance Specialist; Arnold Vang, DrPH, MPH, MSPA, PA, is Deputy Branch Chief; Candice Gilliland, JD, MSFS, Kelly J.
