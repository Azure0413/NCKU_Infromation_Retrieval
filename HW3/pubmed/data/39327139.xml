Our purpose is to provide the response data from the 2023 survey and discuss its insights on the impact of COVID-19 on resident recruitment (Part I) and education (Part II), which can be used to facilitate planning and resource allocation for the evolving needs of programs and their leadership. In Part I, we consider the effects of ERAS preference signaling, the virtual interview format, and the potential of a universal interview release date.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="MATERIALS AND METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">An observational, cross-sectional study of the APDR membership was performed using a web-based survey consisting of 45 questions, 23 of which pertain to virtual recruitment and are discussed in Part I of a two-part survey analysis. All active APDR members (n = 393) were invited to participate in the survey.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The response rate was 32% (124 of 393). 83% reported that signaling increased the likelihood of an interview offer. 96% reported only offering virtual interviews; however, 59% intended to offer virtual-only interviews in the future. 53% would adhere to a universal interview release date but an additional 44% would do so depending on the agreed date, Results were tallied using Qualtrics software and qualitative responses were tabulated or summarized as comments.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Virtual recruitment is expected to continue for many programs and most respondents would accept a universal interview release date. Preference signaling and geographic signaling are considered positive additions to the application process.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024 The Association of University Radiologists.
