In 2021, the Rural Addiction Implementation Network (RAIN) sought to establish a rural hospital/clinic-system practice-based research network (RH-PBRN) to facilitate implementation of evidence-based addiction-related prevention, treatment, and recovery (PTR) services to reduce the morbidity of OUD and substance use disorder (SUD) in rural communities.<i>Objective:</i> To describe the goals and implementation of PTR activities of RAIN, a novel RH-PBRN.<i>Methods:</i> RAIN identified teams of external/internal facilitators at four rural hospitals/clinic-networks to achieve at least 15 PTR activities involving OUD and other SUDs. RAIN utilized an implementation-facilitation approach: facilitators assessed the implementation environment and promoted interventions to overcome barriers to PTR implementation. Other interventions included site visits, community of learning calls, and e-communication. RAIN assessed and recorded facilitators and barriers to implementation, milestone attainment, and outcomes of PTR activities. At 18 months, we queried facilitators about the fidelity and implementation of RAIN activities.<i>Results:</i> RAIN established an HP-PBRN in four sites (Idaho, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming). Within the HP-PBRN, 20 PTR activities were established (<i>p</i> = 7, <i>T</i> = 10, <i>R</i> = 3; range 3-7 per site). Barriers to implementation of PTR activities included competing clinical demands, especially due to COVID-19, lack of dedicated effort for staff at sites, and stigma of addiction and its treatment. Facilitators of implementation included the use of trained expert facilitators and communication between the sites.<i>Conclusions:</i> RAIN implemented 20 addiction-related PTR activities in four rural hospitals/clinic-networks. RAIN's intervention model could be replicated to address addiction-related harms in other rural communities.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Hafen</LastName><ForeName>Kody</ForeName><Initials>K</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Program for Addiction Research, Clinical Care, Knowledge, and Advocacy (PARCKA), University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Epidemiology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Wallace</LastName><ForeName>Harlan</ForeName><Initials>H</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Office of Network Development and Telehealth, University of Utah Health, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>University of Utah Health Regional Network, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Fritz</LastName><ForeName>Kayla</ForeName><Initials>K</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Program for Addiction Research, Clinical Care, Knowledge, and Advocacy (PARCKA), University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Epidemiology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Fordham</LastName><ForeName>Cole</ForeName><Initials>C</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Program for Addiction Research, Clinical Care, Knowledge, and Advocacy (PARCKA), University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Epidemiology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Haskell</LastName><ForeName>Tyler</ForeName><Initials>T</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Program for Addiction Research, Clinical Care, Knowledge, and Advocacy (PARCKA), University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Epidemiology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Kelley</LastName><ForeName>A Taylor</ForeName><Initials>AT</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0003-0462-4737</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Program for Addiction Research, Clinical Care, Knowledge, and Advocacy (PARCKA), University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Vulnerable Veteran Innovative PACT (VIP) Initiative;
