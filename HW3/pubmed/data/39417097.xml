This study aims to comprehensively review organizational resilience of healthcare facilities in terms of its conception, measurement, and impacts on healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A search was conducted in four databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, PsycINFO, and Web of Science) for empirical articles considering organizational resilience among healthcare facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic from 2019 to 2024. Several keywords from three categories ("COVID-19", "organizational resilience," and "healthcare facilities") were used, and RAYYAN was used to manage references.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Four empirical articles from 172 studies were included, which encompassed a total sample of 6,606 healthcare workers from Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and TÃ¼rkiye. Organizational resilience could influence the individual resilience of healthcare practitioners, enhance crisis management and ensure safety performance. The strategies of enhancing organizational resilience at healthcare worker level included staff training, crisis management protocols, collaboration promotion, and stress management approaches. The ones at health facility level included government intervention, funds for hospital preparedness, competency-based crisis management, and mental health programs for healthcare workers. Our review also suggests a lack of empirical studies, no commonly used measurement instruments, and the heterogeneity of study contexts in the research of organizational resilience in public health.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">This review highlights effective strategies to enhance the organizational resilience of healthcare workers and examines their impact during the COVID-19 pandemic. Immediate government action, funding to support hospital preparedness, and the formation of flexible healthcare teams are essential to strengthen organizational resilience among healthcare workers for future crises.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Kaczmarski</LastName><ForeName>Karolina</ForeName><Initials>K</Initials></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Pasha</LastName><ForeName>Atena</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0001-5603-4961</Identifier></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Inusah</LastName><ForeName>Abdul-Hanan Saani</ForeName><Initials>AS</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0009-0007-4483-2473</Identifier></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Li</LastName><ForeName>Xiaoming</ForeName><Initials>X</Initials></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Qiao</LastName><ForeName>Shan</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType><PublicationType UI="D000076942">Preprint</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>10</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>medRxiv</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101767986</NlmUniqueID></MedlineJournalInfo></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>17</Day><Hour>10</Hour><Minute>6</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>17</Day><Hour>10</Hour><Minute>5</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>17</Day><Hour>5</Hour><Minute>4</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pmc-release"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>16</Day></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>epublish</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39417097</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="pmc">PMC11483024</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1101/2024.10.10.24315244</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="pii">2024.10.10.24315244</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
