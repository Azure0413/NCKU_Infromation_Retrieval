This study examines IHCW formation and influencing factors in Hungarian inpatient healthcare institutions. Factors such as hospital type, regional location, indicators related to patient traffic, educational activity, patients of certain types of medical specialties, and healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) were examined. Univariate and multivariate statistical methods identified significant predictors of IHCW occurrence. The generation rate of IHCW ranged from 0.15 to 0.81 kg/bed/day nationally, and it increased by 40.74% between 2017 and 2021, significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The data also showed that as the number of beds increased, the IHCW production rate increased proportionally. The results indicate that IHCW generation rates vary significantly by hospital type, with university hospitals producing the most waste. The incidence of HAI multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections emerged as the primary driver of IHCW generation, along with educational activity, the number of intensive care unit patients, and regional differences. The Southern Great Plain region had the highest IHCW production (0,42 kg/bed/day) among the seven regions studied. The study highlights the critical impact of HAI MDR infections on IHCW production, emphasizing the need for targeted waste management in high-risk areas. Regional differences indicate the necessity for tailored strategies to address local waste management challenges. This study provides essential insights into IHCW formation and influencing factors in Hungary, offering valuable information for policy and practice.<i>Implications</i>: Nowadays, one of the main problems related to waste management is the uncontrollable amount of waste generated in the healthcare sector. Infectious healthcare waste (IHCW) represents a significant biological hazard and a high public health risk, both on an individual and a community level, so a more precise knowledge of these risks is extremely important. In the Central European region, very few studies have dealt with the infectious waste generated in the healthcare sector, and this is the first such research in Hungary. The primary aim of this study is to measure the amount of IHCW produced in various regions and hospital types in Hungary, and to examine the general and specific factors that affect the generation rate of this waste. The findings reveal that IHCW generation rates (GR) vary considerably across different hospital types and regions. This highlights the need for targeted waste management practices in individual institutions. In addition, the study emphasizes the importance of developing region-specific waste management strategies in view of regional inequalities. A crucial insight from the study is that the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), particularly multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections, has the most significant impact on IHCW GR, surpassing other known factors. This suggests that effective control of HAIs, especially MDR bacterial infections, can lead to a substantial reduction in IHCW. The study also showed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic not only on the production of IHCW, but also on individual influencing factors. Overall, the study provides valuable insights for informing policy and practice. By understanding the specific factors influencing IHCW production, policymakers and healthcare practitioners can develop more effective waste management policies and practices. This highlights the need for tailored waste management strategies that take into account the unique characteristics of each hospital type and geographic region, ultimately reducing the healthcare waste burden and providing a healthier and safer environment for all.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Kaposi</LastName><ForeName>Adam</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Hospital Hygiene, University of Debrecen Clinical Centre, Debrecen, Hungary.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Orosz</LastName><ForeName>Nikolett</ForeName><Initials>N</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Hospital Hygiene, University of Debrecen Clinical Centre, Debrecen, Hungary.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Nagy</LastName><ForeName>Attila</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Coordinating Centre for Epidemiology, University of Debrecen Clinical Centre, Debrecen, Hungary.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Health Informatics, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Gomori</LastName><ForeName>Gabriella</ForeName><Initials>G</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Hospital Hygiene, University of Debrecen Clinical Centre, Debrecen, Hungary.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Kocsis</LastName><ForeName>Denes</ForeName><Initials>D</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-5797-9016</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>09</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>J Air Waste Manag Assoc</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>9503111</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1096-2247</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><ChemicalList><Chemical><RegistryNumber>0</RegistryNumber><NameOfSubstance UI="D017744">Medical Waste Disposal</NameOfSubstance></Chemical><Chemical><RegistryNumber>0</RegistryNumber><NameOfSubstance UI="D008506">Medical Waste</NameOfSubstance></Chemical></ChemicalList><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><MeshHeadingList><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D006814" MajorTopicYN="N" Type="Geographic">Hungary</DescriptorName><QualifierName UI="Q000453" MajorTopicYN="N">epidemiology</QualifierName></MeshHeading><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D006801" MajorTopicYN="N">Humans</DescriptorName></MeshHeading><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D003428" MajorTopicYN="Y">Cross Infection</DescriptorName><QualifierName UI="Q000453" MajorTopicYN="N">epidemiology</QualifierName></MeshHeading><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D000086382" MajorTopicYN="Y">COVID-19</DescriptorName><QualifierName UI="Q000453" MajorTopicYN="N">epidemiology</QualifierName></MeshHeading><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D017744" MajorTopicYN="N">Medical Waste Disposal</DescriptorName><QualifierName UI="Q000379" MajorTopicYN="N">methods</QualifierName></MeshHeading><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D008506" MajorTopicYN="N">Medical Waste</DescriptorName></MeshHeading><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D006761" MajorTopicYN="N">Hospitals</DescriptorName></MeshHeading></MeshHeadingList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>28</Day><Hour>18</Hour><Minute>23</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>25</Day><Hour>16</Hour><Minute>18</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>25</Day><Hour>10</Hour><Minute>22</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>ppublish</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39320263</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1080/10962247.2024.2408011</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
