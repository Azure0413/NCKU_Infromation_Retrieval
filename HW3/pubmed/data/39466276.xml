Identifying these sensitive periods can inform when and how parenting is associated with neurodevelopment and risk for mental illness.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVE" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To characterize how harsh and warm parenting during early, middle, and late childhood are associated with brain architecture during adolescence and, in turn, psychiatric symptoms in early adulthood during the COVID-19 pandemic.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">This population-based, 21-year observational, longitudinal birth cohort study of low-income youths and families from Detroit, Michigan; Toledo, Ohio; and Chicago, Illinois, used data from the Future of Families and Child Well-being Study. Data were collected from February 1998 to June 2021. Analyses were conducted from May to October 2023.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="EXPOSURES" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Parent-reported harsh parenting (psychological aggression or physical aggression) and observer-rated warm parenting (responsiveness) at ages 3, 5, and 9 years.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The primary outcomes were brainwide (segregation, integration, and small-worldness), circuit (prefrontal cortex [PFC]-amygdala connectivity), and regional (betweenness centrality of amygdala and PFC) architecture at age 15 years, determined using functional magnetic resonance imaging, and youth-reported anxiety and depression symptoms at age 21 years. The structured life-course modeling approach was used to disentangle timing-dependent from cumulative associations between parenting and brain architecture.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A total of 173 youths (mean [SD] age, 15.88 [0.53] years; 95 female [55%]) were included. Parental psychological aggression during early childhood was positively associated with brainwide segregation (β = 0.30; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.45) and small-worldness (β = 0.17; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.28), whereas parental psychological aggression during late childhood was negatively associated with PFC-amygdala connectivity (β = -0.37; 95% CI, -0.55 to -0.12). Warm parenting during middle childhood was positively associated with amygdala centrality (β = 0.23; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.38) and negatively associated with PFC centrality (β = -0.18; 95% CI, -0.31 to -0.03). Warmer parenting during middle childhood was associated with reduced anxiety (β = -0.05; 95% CI -0.10 to -0.01) and depression (β = -0.05; 95% CI -0.10 to -0.003) during early adulthood via greater adolescent amygdala centrality.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Neural associations with harsh parenting were widespread across the brain in early childhood but localized in late childhood. Neural associations with warm parenting were localized in middle childhood and, in turn, were associated with mental health during future stress. These developmentally contingent associations can inform the type and timing of interventions.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Michael</LastName><ForeName>Cleanthis</ForeName><Initials>C</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Gard</LastName><ForeName>Arianna M</ForeName><Initials>AM</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychology, University of Maryland, College Park.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Tillem</LastName><ForeName>Scott</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Hardi</LastName><ForeName>Felicia A</ForeName><Initials>FA</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychology, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Dunn</LastName><ForeName>Erin C</ForeName><Initials>EC</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Sociology, College of Liberal Arts, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Smith</LastName><ForeName>Andrew D A C</ForeName><Initials>ADAC</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Mathematics and Statistics Research Group, University of the West of England, Bristol, United Kingdom.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>McLoyd</LastName><ForeName>Vonnie C</ForeName><Initials>VC</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Brooks-Gunn</LastName><ForeName>Jeanne</ForeName><Initials>J</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, New York.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Mitchell</LastName><ForeName>Colter</ForeName><Initials>C</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Survey Research Center of the Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Population Studies Center of the Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Monk</LastName><ForeName>Christopher S</ForeName><Initials>CS</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Survey Research Center of the Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Hyde</LastName><ForeName>Luke W</ForeName><Initials>LW</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Survey Research Center of the Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>28</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>JAMA Pediatr</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101589544</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>2168-6203</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>28</Day><Hour>12</Hour><Minute>26</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>28</Day><Hour>12</Hour><Minute>26</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>28</Day><Hour>11</Hour><Minute>34</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39466276</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1001/jamapediatrics.2024.4376</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="pii">2825404</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
