This virus impacted all aspects of life but health-related workplaces particularly, were transformed virtually overnight. Demands were heightened and customary supports came under pressure presenting a huge crisis for health systems. The goal of this study was to explore how this catastrophic pandemic event impacted the wellbeing of healthcare professionals (HCPs) working through this time. Interviews with 57 HCPs from multiple countries and specialty areas were explored utilising inductive content analysis (ICA). Resulting data were then categorised into themes and deductively analysed utilising a method informed by Capability Theory. These were secondary data as the interviews were part of a larger set collected primarily for the purpose of a documentary being made about this experience. This study found that illbeing experiences were prevalent among HCPs. However, significant sources of wellbeing were also evident, and were instrumental in maintaining HCP resilience. Wellbeing was enhanced when HCPs experienced a small number of key <i>capabilities</i> that enabled a broad range of <i>functionings.</i> The <i>capabilities</i> were for (a) participation in positive relationships, (b) a sense of identity, purpose, meaning and value in relation to one's work and (c) ability to provide an appropriate level of medical treatment, care and other role related support. These c<i>apabilities</i> were central to HCP wellbeing irrespective of the individual's location and specialty area, however the ability to realise these <i>capabilities</i> in desired <i>functionings</i> was differentially impacted by each individual's unique circumstances.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>McHugh</LastName><ForeName>Judith</ForeName><Initials>J</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0003-0835-6944</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>University of Otago, New Zealand.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Trotman</LastName><ForeName>Paul</ForeName><Initials>P</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Te Whatu Ora - Southern, New Zealand.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Nicholson</LastName><ForeName>Helen D</ForeName><Initials>HD</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>University of Otago, New Zealand.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Smith-Han</LastName><ForeName>Kelby</ForeName><Initials>K</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>University of Western Australia, Australia.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>06</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>England</Country><MedlineTA>Health (London)</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>9800465</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1363-4593</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Capability Approach</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Covid-19 pandemic</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">content analysis</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">healthcare professional</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">wellbeing</Keyword></KeywordList><CoiStatement>Declaration of conflicting interestsThe author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: All authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.
