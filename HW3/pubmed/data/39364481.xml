They experience biological, emotional, and social changes and require constant affection, support, and supervision during this period. Adolescents often face stressors from various sources, which can exacerbate behavioral issues. A 13-year-old boy, born 15 years after marriage by in vitro fertilization (IVF) to parents in their late 40s, was brought to the outpatient department. He had presented with complaints of getting angry, stealing money, lying, and threatening his parents for his demands for the past six months. His behavior intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic due to social isolation and prolonged home confinement. His parents said that lately, he has also gotten difficult to manage at home. He was diagnosed with conduct disorder. Despite initial management with behavioral therapy, the boy experienced frequent exacerbations of symptoms. Further assessment identified parental behavior as a contributing factor to the child's conduct disorder. Interventions incorporating family-focused therapy (FFT) and modifications in parenting techniques were implemented, resulting in an extended period of behavioral remission. Parenting style plays an instrumental role in defining the positive and negative outcomes a child will experience. Hence, the parents were counseled and psycho-educated about effective parenting. This case underscores the crucial role of parenting styles in influencing adolescent behavior and highlights the importance of family-centered interventions in managing behavioral problems during adolescence.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024, S et al.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>S</LastName><ForeName>Salma</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychiatry, SRM Medical College Hospital and Research Centre, Chennai, IND.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Kaki</LastName><ForeName>Aruna</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychiatry, SRM Medical College Hospital and Research Centre, Chennai, IND.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Rajaram Manoharan</LastName><ForeName>Senthil</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychiatry, Huntsville Hospital, University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, Huntsville, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>T</LastName><ForeName>Madhusudan</ForeName><Initials>M</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychiatry, SRM Medical College Hospital and Research Centre, Chennai, IND.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>R</LastName><ForeName>Arul Saravanan</ForeName><Initials>AS</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychiatry, SRM Medical College Hospital and Research Centre, Chennai, IND.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D002363">Case Reports</PublicationType><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>09</Month><Day>03</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>Cureus</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101596737</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>2168-8184</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">conduct disorder</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">covid-19 pandemic</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">elderly parents</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">family-focused therapy</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">parenting styles</Keyword></KeywordList><CoiStatement>Human subjects: Consent was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
