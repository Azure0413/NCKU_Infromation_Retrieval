In this study, the wastewater survey methods necessary for comprehending the incidence of infection by WBE are clarified. This clarification is based on the correlation with the number of confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, considering factors such as handling non-detect data, calculation method for representative values, analytical sensitivity, analytical reproducibility, sampling frequency, and survey duration. Data collected from 15 samples per week for two and a half years using a highly accurate analysis method were regarded as gold standard data, and the correlation between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA concentrations in wastewater and confirmed COVID-19 cases was analyzed by Monte Carlo simulation under the hypothetical situation where the quality of the wastewater survey method was reduced. Regarding data handling, it was appropriate to replace non-detect data with estimates based on distribution, and to use geometric means to calculate representative values. For the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in samples, using a highly sensitive and reproducible method (non-detect rates of &lt;40 %; ≤0.4 standard deviation) and surveying at least three samples, preferably five samples, per week were considered desirable. Furthermore, conducting the survey over a period of time that included at least 50 weeks was necessary. A WBE that meets these survey criteria is sufficient for the determination of the COVID-19 infection incidence in the catchment. Furthermore, WBE can offer additional insights into infection rates in the catchment, such as the estimated 48 % decrease in confirmed COVID-19 cases visiting a clinic following a COVID-19 legal reclassification in Japan.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024 The Authors.
