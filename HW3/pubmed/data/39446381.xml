Among 88 PM&amp;R residency programs, 67 (77%) had Instagram accounts, 45 (51%) had Twitter accounts, and 41 (47%) had both. Forty (60%) Instagram accounts and 19 (42%) Twitter accounts were opened during the 2020-2021 application cycle, correlating with the introduction of virtual interviews and the COVID-19 pandemic. Residency programs with active Instagram or Twitter accounts had more NRMP applications (F(2,85) = 7.49, P = 0.001). Simple main effects analysis showed that programs with an Instagram account (P = 0.03) or a Twitter account (P = 0.03) received more residency applications. In multivariate linear regression analysis including presence of an Instagram account, program size, program setting, and program region, the presence of a Twitter account (coefficient 37.3, P = 0.04, 95% CI 1.71-72.96) and ≥ 16 residents in the residency program (coefficient 77.9, P &lt; 0.001, 95% CI 44.43-111.31) were positively correlated with the number of residency applications. In conclusion, residency programs that were larger and adopted Twitter had more applicants in 2020-2021. Future research is needed to determine how social media activity impacts residency applicant decision-making.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.
