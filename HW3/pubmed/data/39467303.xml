Following propositions of narrative identity and Terror Management Theory, this qualitative study investigated Chinese emerging adults' identity construction in their narratives of the national outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2022. Participants were 62 college students invited to share their pandemic experiences with reflections. Thematic analysis of the data suggests that the participants shared their pandemic experiences as a process of managing their death terror activated in the pandemic which threatened their sense of self and meanwhile motivated them to reconstruct who they are in the world. Based on their meaning-making capacities, the participants disclosed death awareness and vulnerabilities, adopted a temporal perspective in storytelling, emphasized their interpersonal and social connections, and made meaning out of the pandemic experiences to defend against death terror. As an outcome of their narration, a conformer-explorer identity was constructed in their pandemic narratives and we proposed a dialectical model to capture the dynamics of the construction. Although with limitations, this study contributes to our understanding of the functions of mortality salience on narrative identity among emerging adults in collectivist cultures during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Liu</LastName><ForeName>Yanping</ForeName><Initials>Y</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-7603-136X</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychology, Honghe University, Mengzi, China.</Affiliation><Identifier Source="RINGGOLD">66358</Identifier></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Zhu</LastName><ForeName>Wenyi</ForeName><Initials>W</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Clinical and Public Health, Honghe Health Vocational College, Mengzi, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Hu</LastName><ForeName>Fawen</ForeName><Initials>F</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychology, Honghe University, Mengzi, China.</Affiliation><Identifier Source="RINGGOLD">66358</Identifier></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>28</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>Qual Health Res</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>9202144</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1049-7323</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">a conformerâ€“explorer identity</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">identity construction;</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">mortality salience;</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">pandemic narratives;</Keyword></KeywordList><CoiStatement>Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</CoiStatement></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>28</Day><Hour>18</Hour><Minute>23</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>28</Day><Hour>18</Hour><Minute>23</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>28</Day><Hour>17</Hour><Minute>13</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39467303</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1177/10497323241280394</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
