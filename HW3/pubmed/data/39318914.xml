There is no definitive treatment for COVID-19, but vaccines have been developed that can help prevent severe illness and death. Studies have investigated the effect of vaccination on disease severity and outcome, and the findings indicate that vaccination is linked to a significant reduction in the risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and disease mortality. However, there is a scarcity of evidence in Africa in general, and no similar study has been conducted in Ethiopia yet. Therefore, the study aimed to assess the effect of vaccination on COVID-19 disease severity and the need for ICU admission among hospitalized patients at a private specialty clinic in Ethiopia. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted among 126 patients with COVID-19, 41 vaccinated and 85 unvaccinated, who were hospitalized between September 2021 and May 2022. Data were summarized using frequency (percentage) and median (interquartile range (IQR)). To compare the characteristics of the two groups, Chi-square/Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U tests at p-values of ≤ 0.05 were used. To identify the effect of vaccination on COVID-19 disease severity, a marginal structural model (MSM) with an inverse probability weighting (IPW) approach using a robust Poisson regression model was fitted. Adjusted relative risk (ARR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for ARR were used for interpreting the result. Results The cohort included groups that were comparable in terms of their sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. More than half of the participants were older than 60 years (n = 66, 52.4%), were males (n = 71, 56.3%), and had one or more comorbid illnesses (n = 66, 52.4%). At admission, 85 (67.5%) had severe disease, and 11 (8.7%) progressed after hospitalization and required ICU admission, of which three unvaccinated cases died. From the final model, vaccination was found to be associated with a 62% decreased risk of developing severe COVID-19 disease if infected, compared to not getting vaccinated (ARR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.23-0.65, p &lt; 0.0001). Conclusions The study's findings support previous reports that vaccinated people are less likely to develop severe COVID-19 disease if later infected with the virus, emphasizing the importance of continuing efforts to promote COVID-19 vaccination not only to safeguard individuals but also to confer community-level immunity.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024, Belayneh et al.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Belayneh</LastName><ForeName>Eskedar Kebede</ForeName><Initials>EK</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Internal Medicine, Mulu-G Health Services, Addis Ababa, ETH.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Workneh Leulseged</LastName><ForeName>Tigist</ForeName><Initials>T</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Public Health, Medical Research Lounge (MRL), Addis Ababa, ETH.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Internal Medicine, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, ETH.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Teklu</LastName><ForeName>Blen Solomon</ForeName><Initials>BS</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Internal Medicine, Atlas College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa, ETH.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Tewodros</LastName><ForeName>Bersabel Hilawi</ForeName><Initials>BH</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Internal Medicine, University Medical Care, Silver Spring, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Megiso</LastName><ForeName>Muluken Zeleke</ForeName><Initials>MZ</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Internal Medicine, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv, ISR.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Weldesenbet</LastName><ForeName>Edengenet Solomon</ForeName><Initials>ES</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Internal Medicine, Wachemo University, Hosanna, ETH.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Berhanu</LastName><ForeName>Mefthe Fikru</ForeName><Initials>MF</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Prolato Clinical Research Center, Houston, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Shaweno</LastName><ForeName>Yohannes Shiferaw</ForeName><Initials>YS</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Otolaryngology, Adama General Hospital and Medical College, Adama, ETH.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Hailu</LastName><ForeName>Kirubel Tesfaye</ForeName><Initials>KT</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Public Health, Medical Research Lounge (MRL), Addis Ababa, ETH.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Internal Medicine, Life Map Higher Learning Institute, Addis Ababa, ETH.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>08</Month><Day>25</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>Cureus</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101596737</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>2168-8184</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">causal inference</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">covid-19</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">ethiopia</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">retrospective cohort</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">vaccination</Keyword></KeywordList><CoiStatement>Human subjects: Consent was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
