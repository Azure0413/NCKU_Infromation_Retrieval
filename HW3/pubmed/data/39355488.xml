Since online teaching was an untested approach in Indian medical education, student feedback was essential. This study compares synchronous online lectures with traditional classroom lectures from the students' perspective. Method The cross-sectional study was conducted on undergraduate medical students across India undergoing synchronous online MBBS classes during the COVID-19 pandemic. After obtaining institutional ethical clearance, five-section questionnaires via Google Forms were circulated on WhatsApp and Facebook. The generated quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and frequency analysis. Result Out of 341 responses, 64 students did not consent and were excluded, resulting in 277 responses for analysis. The total score for traditional face-to-face lectures was 11.61 out of 15, with a percentage mean score of 77%, highlighting the significant positive influence of instructor presence and a conducive learning environment. In contrast, synchronous online lectures had a total score of 16.01 out of 25, with a percentage mean score of 64.04%, reflecting mixed responses. The Student's t-test analysis underscored the significant advantages of face-to-face interactions and structured learning environments in traditional classroom settings despite the flexibility and independence offered by synchronous online lectures. Conclusion The findings of this study reveal that students have a moderate level of satisfaction with synchronous online lectures, as indicated by a mean score of 64.04%. While these lectures provide flexibility and promote independence, they require students to exhibit higher levels of self-motivation, discipline, and self-directed learning. However, the online format poses challenges for effective communication and technical issues. Addressing the challenges of technology use, teacher training, and student engagement can enhance the effectiveness of online teaching and ensure that it complements traditional teaching methods, ultimately promoting pedagogical resilience in medical education.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024, Sorte et al.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Sorte</LastName><ForeName>Smita R</ForeName><Initials>SR</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Physiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Nagpur, Nagpur, IND.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Rathod</LastName><ForeName>Sachin B</ForeName><Initials>SB</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Physiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Nagpur, Nagpur, IND.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Chatur</LastName><ForeName>Dipali K</ForeName><Initials>DK</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Physiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Raipur, Raipur, IND.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Dhanvijay</LastName><ForeName>Anup Kumar D</ForeName><Initials>AKD</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Physiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Deoghar, Deoghar, IND.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>09</Month><Day>01</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>Cureus</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101596737</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>2168-8184</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">classroom learning</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">classroom teaching</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">covid 19</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">covid 19 pandemic</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">online medical education</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">online synchronous</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">online teaching</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">synchronous learning</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">synchronous online learning</Keyword></KeywordList><CoiStatement>Human subjects: Consent was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
