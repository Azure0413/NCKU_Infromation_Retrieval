This study examines the impact of the pandemic on parental attachment with children.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHOD" NlmCategory="METHODS">A cross-sectional study was conducted with children visiting a general pediatrics clinic between April 1 and 20, 2023. Their COVID-19 infection history was recorded, and the Kern's Attachment Questionnaire was used to assess parental attachment in children who had contracted COVID-19 and those who had not.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The study involved 716 patients aged 9-12, divided into two groups: those who had contracted COVID-19 (n=253) and those who had not (n=463). Kern's Attachment Questionnaire scores for mothers were 46.3 for children with COVID-19 and 49.4 for those without. For fathers, the scores were 43.9 and 48, respectively. Children who had contracted COVID-19 showed significantly lower attachment scores to both mothers and fathers compared to the control group (p=0.04, p=0.00).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The pandemic's long-term biopsychosocial effects are evident, with increased stress and negative experiences posing risks to child development, particularly in terms of parental attachment. While early attachment begins in infancy, it continues to evolve. This study underscores the need for behavioral and psychological follow-up for adolescents in the post-pandemic period.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024, Karakas et al.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Karakas</LastName><ForeName>Nazmi Mutlu</ForeName><Initials>NM</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Childhood Disease, Gazi University Medical School, Ankara, TUR.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Kuzucu</LastName><ForeName>Selin</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Pediatric Medicine, Sorgun State Hospital, Yozgat, TUR.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>06</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>Cureus</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101596737</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>2168-8184</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">adolescence</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">attachment</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">covid-19</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">covid-19 pandemic</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">parent-child relationship</Keyword></KeywordList><CoiStatement>Human subjects: Consent was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
