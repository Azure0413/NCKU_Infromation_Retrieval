This study aimed to evaluate the perception and satisfaction of medical staff with telemedicine after the COVID-19 pandemic and compare these findings with those during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> Between January and February 2023, a questionnaire regarding the utilization, safety, and satisfaction with telemedicine was administered to 200 medical staff members (100 doctors and 100 nurses). Additionally, open-ended questions were included to gather insights on the strengths, weaknesses, and prerequisites of telemedicine. The satisfaction levels of the medical staff were compared with those from a previous study conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Results:</b> The response rate among medical staff was 60.0% (50 doctors and 70 nurses). Concerning patient safety, 83.3% of respondents indicated a risk of worsening symptoms in chronic patients, and 68.3% expressed concerns about emergencies related to patient safety. Eighty-two percent of doctors preferred in-person visits over telemedicine, while 48.6% of nurses reported equal or greater satisfaction with telemedicine (<i>p</i> = 0.003). The reported strengths of telemedicine included the convenience of outpatient clinics (67%), while its primary weakness was the incomplete assessment of patient conditions (73%). The likelihood of partial substitution of telemedicine for in-person visits was significantly higher in the post-COVID-19 pandemic period compared to during the pandemic (71.7% vs. 49.0%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). <b>Conclusion:</b> In the post-COVID-19 pandemic era, telemedicine continues to offer significant benefits in enhancing patient access to medical care. However, medical staff remain concerned about its safety and show lower satisfaction compared to in-person visits. In response to these concerns, an effective telemedicine platform and legal standards, including practical guidelines, should be developed.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Jung</LastName><ForeName>Seung Eun</ForeName><Initials>SE</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0003-0674-5444</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Radiology, College of Medicine, Eunpyeong St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Kwon</LastName><ForeName>Young-Mi</ForeName><Initials>YM</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0001-6229-5674</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Customer Happiness Team, College of Medicine, Eunpyeong St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Kwon</LastName><ForeName>Soon-Yong</ForeName><Initials>SY</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0001-5531-956X</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Orthopedic Surgery, College of Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Kim</LastName><ForeName>Young-Hoon</ForeName><Initials>YH</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0003-1237-4600</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Orthopedic Surgery, College of Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Park</LastName><ForeName>Hyung-Youl</ForeName><Initials>HY</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-0084-8867</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Orthopedic Surgery, College of Medicine, Eunpyeong St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>09</Month><Day>30</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>Telemed J E Health</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>100959949</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1530-5627</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">medical staff</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">pandemic comparison</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">post-COVID-19 pandemic</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">satisfaction</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">telemedicine</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>30</Day><Hour>22</Hour><Minute>18</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>30</Day><Hour>22</Hour><Minute>18</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>30</Day><Hour>13</Hour><Minute>23</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39348339</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1089/tmj.2024.0142</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
