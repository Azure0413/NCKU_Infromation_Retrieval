The COVID-19 pandemic further hindered students' exposure with the entrance to intensive care units (ICU) limited. To address the problem, this study explored the use of assisted reality technology to create a smart classroom in intensive care.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Six intensive care teaching sessions were live streamed to groups of medical students (<i>n</i> = 33) using wearable assisted reality glasses, and the results were pooled for analysis. Feedback from students and educators was collected using the evaluation of technology-enhanced learning materials (ETELM).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The response rate for the ETELM-learner and ETELM-educator perceptions was 100%. Students strongly agreed that the session was well organised, relevant and that the navigation of technology-based components was logical and efficient. Students strongly disagreed that their learning was negatively affected by technology issues. Educators reported some difficulties with balancing teaching delivery alongside the clinical demands of the ICU and some minor technological issues.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="DISCUSSION" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">There is potential for smart classrooms to revolutionise intensive care education. The use of smart classrooms on intensive care using assisted reality technology was well received by students and educators. The main limitations included the cost of the technology and risk of technology issues. There is a significant role for smart classrooms to continue in the post-pandemic period as they provide an open and safe platform for students to explore intensive care medicine and ask questions that they may feel less able to raise in the busy clinical environment.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© The Intensive Care Society 2023.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Willis</LastName><ForeName>Charlotte</ForeName><Initials>C</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0003-3525-5006</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Northampton General Hospital, Northampton, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>The University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Dawe</LastName><ForeName>Jessica</ForeName><Initials>J</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Northampton General Hospital, Northampton, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Leng</LastName><ForeName>Christopher</ForeName><Initials>C</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Northampton General Hospital, Northampton, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2023</Year><Month>06</Month><Day>05</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>England</Country><MedlineTA>J Intensive Care Soc</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101538668</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1751-1437</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Smart classroom</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">assisted reality technology</Keyword></KeywordList><CoiStatement>The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</CoiStatement></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>26</Day><Hour>10</Hour><Minute>18</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>26</Day><Hour>10</Hour><Minute>17</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>26</Day><Hour>4</Hour><Minute>18</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pmc-release"><Year>2023</Year><Month>6</Month><Day>5</Day></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>ppublish</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39323596</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="pmc">PMC11421280</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1177/17511437231178207</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="pii">10.1177_17511437231178207</ArticleId></ArticleIdList><ReferenceList><Reference><Citation>
