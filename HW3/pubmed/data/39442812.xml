At present, the emergence of many new variants and mutants were found to be more harmful compared to the previous strains. As a result, research scientists around the world had devoted significant efforts to understand the mechanism, causes and transmission due to COVID-19 along with the treatment to cure these diseases. However, despite achieving several findings, much more was unknown and yet to be explored. Hence, along with these developments, it is also extremely essential to design effective systems by incorporating smart materials to battle the COVID-19. Therefore, several approaches have been implemented to combat against COVID-19. Recently, the graphene-based materials have been explored for the current COVID-19 and future pandemics due to its superior physicochemical properties, providing efficient nanoplatforms for optical and electrochemical sensing and diagnostic applications with high sensitivity and selectivity. Moreover, based on the photothermal effects or reactive oxygen species formation, the carbon-based nanomaterials have shown its potentiality for targeted antiviral drug delivery and the inhibitory effects against pathogenic viruses. Therefore, this review article sheds light on the recent progress and the most promising strategies related to graphene and related materials and its applications for detection, decontamination, diagnosis, and protection against COVID-19. In addition, the key challenges and future directives are discussed in detail for fundamental design and development of technologies based on graphene-based materials along with the demand aspects of graphene-based products and lastly, our personal opinions on the appropriate approaches to improve these technologies respectively.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
