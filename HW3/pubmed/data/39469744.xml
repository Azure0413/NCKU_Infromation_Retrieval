The evaluations happened in three moments: at hospital discharge, 30 days after discharge and 90 days after discharge. The instruments applied are the following: handgrip dynamometer, Montreal Cognitive Assessment Basic questionnaire (MoCA-B), Barthel Index (BI), timed up and go test (TUG), hospital anxiety and depressive scale (HADS) and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey questionary (SF-36).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">74 individuals were eligible to participate in the study, 25 of which were followed for 90 days. Based on the results of the MoCA-b, there were no relevant cognitive changes after 3 months. According to the Barthel Index applied to each of the evaluations, the percentage of subjects that were classified as independent or minimally dependent was 48%, 92% then 96%, respectively, demonstrating that individuals can achieve a good degree of functional independence after 3 months. Despite that, the SF-36 demonstrated a score below the South Brazilian normal in some domains.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The individuals studied did not present persistent cognitive changes after 3 months and functional capacity showed significant improvement during this period. However, when the assessment is about the self-perceived quality of life, the majority of domain values are still below expectations, deserving attention by the health professionals involved.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Carneiro</LastName><ForeName>Juliana Cristina Foga√ßa</ForeName><Initials>JCF</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Master's student in the Postgraduate Program in Rehabilitation Sciences, Federal University of Health Sciences of Porto Alegre (UFCSPA), Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.</Affiliation><Identifier Source="RINGGOLD">117303</Identifier></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Inpatient Physical Therapy, Hospital Moinhos de Vento, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Biasibetti</LastName><ForeName>Mayco</ForeName><Initials>M</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Undergraduate student of the Physiotherapy Course, Federal University of Health Sciences of Porto Alegre (UFCSPA), Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.</Affiliation><Identifier Source="RINGGOLD">117303</Identifier></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Rodrigues</LastName><ForeName>Folly</ForeName><Initials>F</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Inpatient Physical Therapy, Hospital Moinhos de Vento, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Barroso</LastName><ForeName>Gustavo de Castro</ForeName><Initials>GC</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0003-1090-2828</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Physical Therapy, Federal University of Health Sciences of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil1.Department of Physical Therapy, Federal University of Health Sciences of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Cechetti</LastName><ForeName>Fernanda</ForeName><Initials>F</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Professor of the Physiotherapy course and Researcher at the Postgraduate Program in Rehabilitation Sciences, Federal University of Health Sciences of Porto Alegre (UFCSPA), Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.</Affiliation><Identifier Source="RINGGOLD">117303</Identifier></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>29</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>J Intensive Care Med</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>8610344</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>0885-0666</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">cognitive disfunction</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">functional independence</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">intensive care unit</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">patient discharge</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">post-Acute COVID-19 syndrome</Keyword></KeywordList><CoiStatement>Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</CoiStatement></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>29</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>23</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>29</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>23</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>29</Day><Hour>4</Hour><Minute>52</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39469744</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1177/08850666241291513</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
