This systematic review assessed whether there was a difference in eating behavior between sexes during the COVID-19 pandemic. A search of nine databases (Medline/Pubmed, Embase, Scielo, VHL, Scopus, PsycINFO, Web of Science, ProQuest, Google Scholar) was conducted in October 2023. Studies reporting eating behaviors in males and females during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Methodological quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Instrument. Stratified meta-analyses were conducted using the STATA software. Of the 2388 studies identified, 45 were included in the qualitative synthesis, and 36 in the meta-analysis, encompassing a total of 35,792 participants. Validated questionnaires were used to assess eating behavior, including the TFEQ (33.3%), DEBQ (24.4%), EEQ (22.2%), EES (11.1%), EOQ-5 (2.2%), AEBQ (2.2%), EAS (2.2%), and EMAQ (2.2%). Overall, males exhibited lower scores in emotional eating (Cohen's d = -0.32, 95%CI: 0.46 to -0.17) and restrained eating (Hedges'g = -0.11, 95%CI: 0.16 to -0.06) compared to females. However, the subgroup analysis indicated no differences in emotional eating (subgroup difference p = 0.39) or restrained eating (subgroup difference p = 0.30) according to the year of pandemic. These findings underscore the importance of sex-specific interventions, the address eating behaviors during periods of heightened insecurity in worldwide health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, our results emphasize the necessity for public health strategies to monitor and promote healthy eating behaviors to mitigate their impact on overall health outcomes, even in males, as their eating behavior may be affected over the course of a global health crisis, as well as females.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
