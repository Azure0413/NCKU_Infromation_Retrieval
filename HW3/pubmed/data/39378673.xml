While these changes have enhanced medical training, they have introduced challenges, particularly in resident wellness. The well-being of residents is critical for patient care and the healthcare system. This review aims to provide an overview of the historical trends in medical residency, focusing on the evolution of resident wellness and its associated challenges.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">A narrative review was conducted, examining the evolution and challenges of medical residency with an emphasis on resident wellness. An exhaustive literature search on January 25, 2024 was conducted across PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The search utilized keywords related to medical residency, wellness, and educational reforms. Articles were selected based on relevance and robust evidence, and information was organized into thematic categories for narrative synthesis.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The search yielded 57 publications that met the inclusion criteria. Historical trends revealed a shift from an apprenticeship model to formalized training programs, with each phase bringing unique challenges to resident wellness. The Flexner Report's influence on standardizing medical education, the rise of modern residency programs, and the recognition of burnout as a significant issue were key developments. Policy changes, technological impacts, and the COVID-19 pandemic have further shaped residency training and wellness. Studies highlight the need for interventions addressing burnout and promoting wellness, with varied approaches across specialties and institutions.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Residency burnout has been a growing concern since the 1970s, exacerbated by advancements in medicine, technology, and recent global events like the COVID-19 pandemic. Although awareness has increased, the need remains to address burnout and promote wellness during residency. Further research is warranted to develop effective interventions and adapt training to meet the evolving needs of residents.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2024 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.
