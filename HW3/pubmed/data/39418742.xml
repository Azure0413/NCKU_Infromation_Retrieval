Our current study aims to investigate the relationship between differential gene expression of immune response and progression of COVID-19. A total of 50 participants of COVID-19 group were studied, compared with 39 participants of healthy control group. There were different gene expression profiles in pathways of activation of neutrophil, defense response and adaptive immune response for COVID-19 group before treatment compared to the healthy control group. Distinct gene expression profiles showed that pathways of chemotaxis, immune response and antibacterial humoral response involved in rehabilitation of severe COVID-19 group while pathways of immune system process, defense response to virus and negative regulation of viral genome replication involved in rehabilitation of moderate COVID-19 group. Both protein expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 levels and protein expression of low affinity Fc-receptor FcγRIIIb levels were significantly and positively correlated with COVID-19-IgM levels and might be suitable as biomarkers for monitoring of COVID-19. This study showed that differential gene expression of immune response predicted onset and rehabilitation of COVID-19.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.
