Post-pandemic, medical schools must evaluate how these disruptions shaped student experiences to optimize the return to in-person learning. <b><i>Approach:</i></b> This cross-sectional qualitative study explored medical students' perceptions of their learning environment during the post-pandemic reintegration period in Oman. Fifty-four preclinical and clinical students participated in six focus group interviews. Content analysis identified key topics characterizing students' perceptions of change and change processes in the post-pandemic learning environment. The panarchy framework, developed to characterize complex adaptive systems in nature, was used to frame the results. <b><i>Findings:</i></b> The return to in-person environments presented a mix of renewed connectivity, involving collaborative benefits alongside transitional adjustment strains. Five major topics characterizing student perceptions of change and change processes in their post-pandemic learning environment were identified: learning skills, developing clinical competence, faculty interactions, physical atmosphere, and social connections. Managing academic schedules and cognitive load as the learning environment opened challenged students' learning skills. Learners valued a renewed opportunity for interactive application of knowledge through collaboration, patient contact, and empathy skill-building to feel prepared for future practice. Returning to in-person instruction renewed a sense of community and peer support networks disrupted by pandemic isolation. Some students continued to struggle with study-life imbalance and felt ill-equipped to handle post-pandemic demands. Improved access to student support and wellness services was emphasized to ease transitional stresses. Students defined an ideal learning climate as supportive, active, personalized, relevant, challenging, accessible, and collaborative. <b><i>Insights:</i></b> While pandemic disruptions posed challenges, they provide opportunities to strengthen the educational system's resilience moving forward. Our findings highlight an opportunity for medical educators and learners to capitalize on the innovations that emerged during this period, integrating technology with interactive learning activities and reconnecting students with the core values of the medical profession. Applying the panarchy framework to frame this adaptive process could enable the tracking of multi-level interactions within the medical education environment and the evaluation of interventions targeted at identified areas of concern. Further exploration to achieve complete mapping of specific environmental domains onto the panarchical cycles merits future investigation to build integrated resilience frameworks.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Prashanth</LastName><ForeName>Gowda Parameshwara</ForeName><Initials>GP</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-4024-905X</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Paediatrics, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, National University of Science and Technology, Sohar, Oman.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Mohammed</LastName><ForeName>Ciraj Ali</ForeName><Initials>CA</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Medical Education Unit, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, National University of Science and Technology, Sohar, Oman.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>06</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>Teach Learn Med</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>8910884</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1040-1334</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">COVID-19 pandemic</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Oman</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">graduate medical education</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">qualitative research</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>6</Day><Hour>22</Hour><Minute>17</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>6</Day><Hour>22</Hour><Minute>17</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>6</Day><Hour>13</Hour><Minute>3</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39369408</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1080/10401334.2024.2411575</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
