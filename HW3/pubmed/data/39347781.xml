Systemic ableism impacted their well-being, access, and ability to be active members of their community. Disabled experiences and voices must be heard and amplified to improve preparedness and address ableism. Disability Twitter is one avenue where the disability community can collectively listen and support one another. These voices can and should be used to influence policy and practice. This study used Disability Twitter to represent and honor the experiences of the disability community, using the COVID-19 pandemic as a moment in time.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESEARCH METHOD/DESIGN" NlmCategory="METHODS">Qualitative thematic analysis of U.S.-based Twitter posts was conducted using retrospective social media posts. A total of 238 initial tweets from January 1, 2020 and September 30, 2022 were analyzed by the research team.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Five themes were observed including ableism, devaluation, worthiness, act of reclaiming, and emotion. Disabled people reported instances of ableism, devaluation, and victimization by individuals, systems, and government entities throughout the pandemic. Disabled individuals utilized Twitter to share their collective experiences, urging society to address and respond to the needs of the disability community.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Using social media to center the perspectives of the disability community can invoke system-wide change and inform policies. Implications for combating systemic ableism and promoting allyship for clinical professionals, research scholars, and educators are provided.
