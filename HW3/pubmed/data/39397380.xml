In this descriptive study, we aimed to show the change of the frequency and amount of alcohol consumption in Japan before and during the COVID-19 pandemic periods.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">We analysed data from annual health-check-ups among Japanese workers from April 2018 to March 2021. Changes in the frequency (daily, occasionally, rarely/never) and amount per one-time (four categories by Japanese alcohol unit) of alcohol consumed among 331,200 participants were summarised by sex as 1-year changes in the periods before (FY2018 to FY2019) and during (FY2019 to FY2020) the COVID-19 pandemic.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Among daily drinkers and rarely/never drinkers, overall, 1-year changes in the frequency of alcohol consumption during the pandemic were mostly consistent compared with changes before the pandemic, for both sexes. The number of occasional drinkers who drank less frequently a year later increased during the pandemic compared with before the pandemic (from 9.6% to 11.6% among men and 12.9% to 16.5% among women); however, occasional drinkers who drank more frequently showed a small increase. Collectively, both men and women showed a slight decrease in both the frequency and amount of alcohol consumption during the pandemic among occasional drinkers.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">No major shifts in alcohol consumption habits occurred during the pandemic in our study population. Occasional drinkers tended to drink less during the pandemic, suggesting that initial concerns about increased alcohol consumption owing to the pandemic were unfounded.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© The Author(s) [2024].
