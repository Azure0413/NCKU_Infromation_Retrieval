Data analyses were performed in April to May 2024.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Age-adjusted incidence rate per 100 000 US adults, changes in incidence, estimated number of undiagnosed cases, and mean cancer size.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Absolute rates of overall thyroid cancer incidence in the first quarter of 2016 and of 2019 were 21.0 and 18.8 per 100 000, respectively. From 2020 through 2021, the quarterly rates were 17.3, 11.1, 17.2, 17.9, 17.4, 19.0, 17.1, and 17.3 per 100 000, respectively. The observed incidence of thyroid cancers decreased by 11% for papillary cancers 2 cm or smaller (risk ratio [RR], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83-0.95), 14% for papillary cancers larger than 2 cm (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79-0.93), 8% for follicular cancers (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.82-0.92), 10% for medullary cancers (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.78-1.04), and 15% for anaplastic cancers (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.68-1.07) from March 2020 to December 2021. Oncocytic cancers declined in incidence early in the pandemic, but rates returned to baseline or above through 2021 (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.97-1.37). Extrapolated to the general US population, the total estimated number of thyroid cancer cases not diagnosed (expected minus observed) from March 2020 to December 2021 was approximately 10 200: 5400 papillary cancers 2 cm or smaller (95% CI, 2380-8530), 3700 papillary cancers larger than 2 cm (95% CI, 1660-5810), 600 follicular cancers (95% CI, -260 to 1550), 300 medullary cancers (95% CI, -110 to 720), and 190 anaplastic cancers (95% CI, -75 to 530). Mean size at diagnosis did not change significantly between 2016 and 2021 for any histologic type.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">This longitudinal study found that by the end of 2021, many thyroid cancers remained undiagnosed. These were predominantly small papillary cancers but also affected all histologic types except oncocytic. These deficits in diagnosis could produce a temporary increase in the rate of patients presenting with larger or more advanced stage cancers in the future, and consequently, temporary increases in population morbidity and mortality.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Bell</LastName><ForeName>Rebecca</ForeName><Initials>R</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Section of Otolaryngology-Head &amp; Neck Surgery, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>The VA Outcomes Group, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, White River Junction, Vermont.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Weinberger</LastName><ForeName>Daniel M</ForeName><Initials>DM</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, Connecticut.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Venkatesh</LastName><ForeName>Manasa</ForeName><Initials>M</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Surgery, School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Wisconsin, Madison.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Fernandes-Taylor</LastName><ForeName>Sara</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Surgery, School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Wisconsin, Madison.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Francis</LastName><ForeName>David O</ForeName><Initials>DO</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Surgery, School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Wisconsin, Madison.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Davies</LastName><ForeName>Louise</ForeName><Initials>L</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>The VA Outcomes Group, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, White River Junction, Vermont.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Surgery-Otolaryngology-Head &amp; Neck Surgery and The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy &amp; Clinical Practice, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Associate Editor, JAMA Otolaryngology-Head &amp; Neck Surgery.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>10</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101589542</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>2168-6181</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>13</Day><Hour>21</Hour><Minute>10</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>13</Day><Hour>21</Hour><Minute>10</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>10</Day><Hour>11</Hour><Minute>32</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39388144</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1001/jamaoto.2024.3146</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="pii">2824744</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
