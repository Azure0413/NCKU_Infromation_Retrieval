While unionization resulted in increased compensation and benefits, the process of union negotiations may have created adversarial relationships between residents and their institutions' leadership, who residents depend on for supervision and the development of clinical expertise. Such adversarial relationships could affect the learning environment, which is critical to the delivery of high-quality care. In this commentary, the authors suggest that academic medical centers should offer residents an authentic seat at the institutional care delivery leadership table, ensuring residents' full participation in key organizational decisions. Doing so represents an alternative to unionization, with its potentially adversarial relationships, while still achieving a key goal of residents-to be included in the decisions that affect them and the care they provide. In this way, residents can use their unique understanding of the institutions' strengths and weaknesses to improve the quality of patient care and the learning environment. Such engagement can also help residents achieve competence in systems-based practice and provide a vital link between institutions and the patients and community they serve through health policy and advocacy activities.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2024 the Association of American Medical Colleges.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Sklar</LastName><ForeName>David</ForeName><Initials>D</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>D.
