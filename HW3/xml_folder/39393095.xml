Therefore, hydrocephalus-related surgical volume should have remained constant. The goal of this study was to evaluate the rates of hydrocephalus surgeries in the COVID-19 era compared with the baseline pre-COVID-19 era.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Ten institutions collected information about all hydrocephalus-related surgeries performed between March 2018 and February 2022. The period after March 1, 2020, was considered the COVID-19 era; the period prior to this date was considered the baseline pre-COVID era. Four COVID surge periods were defined using the New York Times COVID-19 database. Total case volumes were compared between the COVID era and baseline, both overall and for each surge period. Sex, race, ethnicity, insurance status, Area Deprivation Index (ADI), and rural-urban commuter area were collected for each surgery. Proportions of patients were then compared overall and for each surge based on these variables.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Of 8056 procedures, 54% were in male patients (n = 4375), 65% in White patients (n = 5247), 18% in Hispanic patients (n = 1423), and 54% in patients with public insurance (n = 4371). There was no change in the number of surgeries per site per month in the COVID era compared with baseline (16.7 vs 17.9, p = 0.113). However, there was a significant decrease in the first surge period (April 2020; 11.5 vs 17.7, p = 0.034). Male sex (p &lt; 0.0039) and Black race (p &lt; 0.001) were found to be associated with a significantly higher proportion of hydrocephalus procedures during the COVID-19 era. Some surge periods showed different proportions of privately insured patient and ADI levels. However, these relationships were inconsistent between surges.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Overall average monthly case numbers were not significantly different between the pre-COVID and COVID eras. There was a significant decrease in hydrocephalus surgery during the first COVID surge. More hydrocephalus surgeries were performed in children of male sex and Black race proportionally during the COVID period overall, but not during individual surges.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Lundy</LastName><ForeName>Paige</ForeName><Initials>P</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>1Department of
