Telemedicine's rapid and widespread adoption altered the delivery of care. This study describes the characteristics of patients undergoing telemedicine visits with hand surgeons, without COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">All telemedicine encounters for 4 hand surgeons at a single institution between September 2022 and September 2023 were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographics were recorded as well as the encounter type. The distance of the patients' residential address and the area deprivation index (ADI) were recorded.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Sixty patient encounters were recorded. Forty-seven percent were male and 53% were female, 5 (8.3%) were new patients, 44 (73.3%) were established patients, and 11 (18.3%) were postoperative. The mean age was 43, and the mean and median distances from the clinic were 72 and 18 miles, respectively. Forty-three patients (72%) were from high ADI residences. Upon comparison of low ADI (0-50th percentile) and high ADI (50th-100th percentile) patients, no statistically significant differences in age, sex, distance from clinic, or encounter type were found.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Telemedicine in hand surgery at this single institution is most frequently used for follow-up encounter types in patients living in high ADI communities, far from clinic sites. Low or high ADI did not correlate with seasonal changes in the use of telemedicine, encounter type, or patient demographics. Telemedicine may improve patient access to hand surgery follow-up care. This may particularly benefit patients facing geographic and economic challenges to healthcare access.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="LEVEL OF EVIDENCE" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Prognostic Level IV.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Falade</LastName><ForeName>Oluleke</ForeName><Initials>O</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, PA, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Munsch</LastName><ForeName>Maria A</ForeName><Initials>MA</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-8894-0608</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Pittsburgh, PA, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Latario</LastName><ForeName>Luke</ForeName><Initials>L</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Pittsburgh, PA, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Fowler</LastName><ForeName>John R</ForeName><Initials>JR</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Pittsburgh, PA, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>18</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>Hand (N Y)</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101264149</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1558-9447</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">epidemiology</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">outcomes</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">psychosocial</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">research and health outcomes</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">specialty</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">surgery</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">treatment</Keyword></KeywordList><CoiStatement>Declaration of Conflicting InterestsJF has received payment in his role as a consultant for Integra LifeSciences corporation.
