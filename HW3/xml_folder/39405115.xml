New vaccine formulations are based on circulating strains of virus, which have tended to evolve to more readily transmit human to human and to evade the neutralizing antibody response. An assumption of this approach is that ancestral strains of virus will not recur. Recurrence of these strains could be a problem for individuals not previously exposed to ancestral spike protein by vaccination or infection. Here, we addressed this question by infecting mice with recent SARS-CoV-2 variants and then challenging them with a highly pathogenic mouse-adapted virus closely related to the ancestral Wuhan-1 strain (SARS2-N501YMA30). We found that challenged mice were protected from death and substantial weight loss, even though they generally had low or no neutralizing antibody response to SARS2-N501YMA30 at the time of reinfection. T cell depletion from the previously infected mice did not diminish infection against clinical disease, although it did result in delayed kinetics of virus clearance in the nasal turbinate and in some cases, in the lungs. Levels of tissue resident memory T cells were significantly elevated in the nasal turbinate of previously infected mice compared to mice that had no previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2. However, this phenotype was not seen in lung tissues. Together, these results indicate that the immune response to newly circulating variants afforded protection against re-infection with the ancestral virus that was at least in part T cell based.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Odle</LastName><ForeName>Abby</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, United States of America.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Kar</LastName><ForeName>Meenakshi</ForeName><Initials>M</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Center for Childhood Infections and Vaccines of Children's Healthcare of At, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, United States of America.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Verma</LastName><ForeName>Abhishek K</ForeName><Initials>AK</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, United States of America.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Sariol</LastName><ForeName>Alan</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, United States of America.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Meyerholz</LastName><ForeName>David K</ForeName><Initials>DK</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Pathology, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, United States of America.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Suthar</LastName><ForeName>Mehul S</ForeName><Initials>MS</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Center for Childhood Infections and Vaccines of Children's Healthcare of At, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, United States of America.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Wong</LastName><ForeName>Lok-Yin Roy</ForeName><Initials>LR</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, United States of America.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Perlman</LastName><ForeName>Stanley</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, United States of America.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>15</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>JCI Insight</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101676073</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>2379-3708</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Adaptive immunity</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">COVID-19</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">T cells</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Virology</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>15</Day><Hour>22</Hour><Minute>18</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>15</Day><Hour>22</Hour><Minute>18</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>15</Day><Hour>12</Hour><Minute>3</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39405115</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1172/jci.insight.184074</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="pii">184074</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
