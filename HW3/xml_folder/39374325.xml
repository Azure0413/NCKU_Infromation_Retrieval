The second phase involved a survey of 120 elderly individuals with hearing loss, divided into hearing aid users and non-users for assessing communication challenges. Data was collected from comprehensive audiology clinics using a series of checklists. <b>Results:</b> Analysis of the frequency of services related to hearing aids revealed that during the peak period, the majority of visits were for acquiring batteries and hearing aids, while fewer visits were for fitting and fine-tuning the devices. After vaccination the pattern was changed. In the second phase, significant differences were observed between the hearing aid users and non-users with regards to their ability to comprehend speech while wearing mask, communicating at a safe distance, and following TV news. <b>Conclusions:</b> The distribution of requested services differed during the peak period and the post-vaccination period. There was a noticeable increase in the purchase and fitting of hearing aids after vaccination. However, patients encountered difficulties due to the limited availability of tele-audiology services and delayed services from hearing aid companies. The benefits of hearing aids were impacted by the pandemic as many people did not seek adjustments for their devices.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Rahimi</LastName><ForeName>Vida</ForeName><Initials>V</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Audiology, School of Rehabilitation, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Tavanai</LastName><ForeName>Elham</ForeName><Initials>E</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-9844-3111</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Audiology, School of Rehabilitation, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Taghavi</LastName><ForeName>Seyyed Mohammad Reza</ForeName><Initials>SMR</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Audiology, School of Rehabilitation, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Khalili</LastName><ForeName>Mohammad Ehsan</ForeName><Initials>ME</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Communication Science &amp; Disorders, University of Iowa, Iowa City, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>07</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>England</Country><MedlineTA>Disabil Rehabil Assist Technol</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101255937</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1748-3107</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><OtherAbstract Type="plain-language-summary" Language="eng"><AbstractText>People who receive hearing aids without requiring further adjustments may experience difficulties in speech perception and auditory function in situations where communication barriers are increased, such as during a pandemic.The most significant challenge identified by audiologists is that people prefer in-person care. However, from the patientsâ€™ perspective, the lack of tele-audiology services is the most important challenge for hearing health services. Therefore, it is crucial to focus on the development of tele-audiology in developing countries. Its implementation is as essential as training audiologists.The pandemic and its preventive measures have affected the benefits of using hearing aids, with many people not seeking the most effective adjustments in this condition.</AbstractText></OtherAbstract><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Audiology services</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">COVID-19</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Tele-audiology</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">hearing aids</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">hearing loss</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>7</Day><Hour>22</Hour><Minute>18</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>7</Day><Hour>22</Hour><Minute>18</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>7</Day><Hour>13</Hour><Minute>53</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39374325</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1080/17483107.2024.2405557</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
