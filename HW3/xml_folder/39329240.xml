About one billion people worldwide are estimated to have vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. Vitamin D deficiency is common among people with COPD, and has been reported to be associated with reduced lung function and increased risk of acute exacerbations of COPD. Several clinical trials of vitamin D to prevent acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) and improve COPD control have been conducted, but an up-to-date meta-analysis of all double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of this intervention is lacking.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVES">To assess the effects of vitamin D for the management of acute exacerbations and symptoms for people with COPD.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="SEARCH METHODS">We searched the Cochrane Airways Trials Register and reference lists of articles. We also searched trial registries directly, and contacted the authors of studies in order to identify additional trials. The date of the last search was 24 August 2022.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="SELECTION CRITERIA">We included double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of vitamin D or its hydroxylated metabolites, for adults with a clinical diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease based on the presence of characteristic symptoms and irreversible airflow obstruction. We did not impose restrictions regarding disease severity or baseline vitamin D status, in order to maximise generalisability.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS">We used standard Cochrane methods. The primary outcome was the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations (requiring systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics or both). We also performed subgroup analyses to determine whether the effect of vitamin D on the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations was modified by baseline vitamin D status, COPD severity or regular inhaled corticosteroid use. The main secondary outcomes of interest were the proportion of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (moderate or severe), the change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1, % predicted) and the proportion of participants with one or more serious adverse events of any cause, mortality (all-cause) and quality of life. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="MAIN RESULTS">We included 10 double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials in this review, involving a total of 1372 adults. Five studies contributed to the primary outcome analysis of the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics or both. The duration of studies ranged from six weeks to 40 months, and all investigated the effects of administering cholecalciferol (vitamin D<sub>3</sub>). One study included two intervention arms, one where vitamin D<sub>3</sub> was given and one where calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) was given. The majority of participants had mild to moderate COPD, and profound vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) &lt; 25 nmol/L) at baseline was rare (123 participants contributing data to subgroup analysis). Administration of vitamin D or its hydroxylated metabolites results in little to no change in the overall rate of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics or both (rate ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.11; 5 studies, 980 participants; high-certainty evidence). Vitamin D supplementation did not influence any meta-analysed secondary outcomes. These were all based on moderate- or high-certainty evidence aside from adverse events and quality of life, which were based on low-certainty evidence. We observed little to no change in the proportion of participants experiencing one or more moderate or severe exacerbations (odds ratio (OR) 0.94, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.24; 5 studies, 980 participants; high-certainty evidence). Additionally, vitamin D probably results in little to no difference in the inter-arm mean change in FEV1 (% predicted) (mean difference 2.82 higher in intervention arm, 95% CI -2.42 to 8.06; 7 studies, 1063 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was also probably no effect of vitamin D on the incidence of serious adverse events due to any cause; although we identified an anticipated absolute effect of 36 additional adverse events per 1000 people, the confidence interval included the null hypothesis of no effect (OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.71; 5 studies, 663 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Vitamin D may have little to no effect on mortality (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.21; 6 studies, 1019 participants; low-certainty evidence). It also may have little to no effect on quality of life as measured by validated instruments (narrative findings; 5 studies, 663 participants; low-certainty evidence). We assessed one study as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain; this did not contribute data to the meta-analysis of the primary outcome reported above. Sensitivity analysis that excluded this study from the meta-analysed outcome to which it contributed, the inter-arm mean change in FEV1, did not change the findings.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS">We found that administration of vitamin D results in little to no effect on the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics or both or the proportion of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (moderate or severe) (both high-certainty evidence). Further, vitamin D probably has no effect on the inter-arm difference in change in lung volumes and the proportion of participants with one or more serious adverse event of any cause (both moderate-certainty evidence), and may make little to no difference to mortality or quality of life (both low-certainty evidence). We recommend further research on the balance of benefits and harms of vitamin D supplements in COPD for those with very low or very high starting vitamin D levels, because we assessed the available evidence as low-certainty for these groups.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024 The Cochrane Collaboration.
