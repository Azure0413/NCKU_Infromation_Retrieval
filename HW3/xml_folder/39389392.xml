This study on Asháninka herbal medicine offers an insight into the Asháninka aetiological system, resting within the wider ontological framework of animism, and cultural expressions of the biomedical understanding of illnesses.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="AIM OF THE STUDY" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">To document wild-grown (non-cultivated) plant species in current use by the Asháninka people and look closer at their herbal practices during the Covid-19 pandemic. The study examines whether the knowledge and use of medicinal plants is gendered in this society. It also compares the findings with available literature concerning the Arawakan groups from Peruvian Amazonia.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="MATERIAL AND METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">The fieldwork was conducted in 13 native communities of the Asháninka people along the Tambo River (Selva Central), Peru, between 2016 and 2018 and in 2022. The main field technique were guided walks in the forest with 27 female and 28 male participants, during which voucher specimens were collected and relevant information was recorded. Semi-structured interviews were performed with specialists in Asháninka traditional medicine and with lay Asháninka people to better understand Asháninka illness aetiologies. The analysis of medicinal plants included medicinal categories and uses, modes of preparations, the frequency of use and the knowledge about the plants between the genders. It also presents and discusses detailed testimonies of herbal remedies during the Covid-19 pandemic. The list of recorded plants was compared with ethnobotanical studies of other Arawakan groups from Peruvian Amazonia.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Altogether, 169 wild-grown medicinal plant species were documented. Our findings highlight the importance of the Piperaceae and Acanthaceae botanical families in the Asháninka pharmacopoeia. The plants were used for 23 medicinal categories, of which dermatological disorders, digestive problems and venomous bites were the most prevalent. Over 70% of recorded plants were commonly and moderately known by the study participants. More exclusive species were found among the men than women; however, 64 % of all recorded plants were known to both genders. Sixty-one percent of recorded plants were not mentioned by any other study of medicinal plants among other Arawakan groups in Peruvian Amazonia. During the Covid-19 pandemic, nobody in the native communities at the Tambo River died directly due to the virus, which was attributed, amongst others, to effective and culturally-appropriate prophylaxis and treatments with medicinal plants.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">To this day, the Asháninka people at the Tambo River conserve the knowledge and practices related to medicinal plants which meet the daily needs of dwelling in subtropical forest; these are deeply rooted in animistic ontology, with the emphasis on spirit predation and retaliation. And yet, numerous applications of plants are compatible with the biomedical notion of illness and symptoms. Plant knowledge is shared between the genders, although specific plants exist for men and women, which are related to their gendered social and family roles. Some overlap and consensus exists with other studies regarding medicinal uses, which reflects the rich and diverse knowledge of medicinal plants among the Arawakan groups in Peruvian Amazonia, and this deserves further study.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.
