Although the International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria require that the new onset continuous headache be present for at least three months before diagnosing NDPH, the biologic basis for when a new, continuous headache starts to behave as NDPH is unknown, and some pediatric headache experts consider that the minimum duration criterion could be shorter.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">In this retrospective study, we reviewed the intake questionnaires and medical records of 5-17 year-olds seen in neurology clinic for headache at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Those with a new onset continuous headache of at least one month in duration were eligible. The patient's self-report and clinician's description both had to indicate that the headache was new, of abrupt onset, and continuous to be included, although patients were allowed to have a prior history of infrequent headaches. We compared headache outcomes at last follow-up and at one year after continuous headache onset between those who had a continuous headache duration of 1 to &lt;3 months ("new onset headache", or NOH) at first visit vs. those with ≥3 months (NDPH). We used multivariate regression modeling to examine for predictors of headache outcomes.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Of 472 patient records reviewed, 172 met the inclusion criteria for analysis. Of these, 84 had a headache duration of 1 to &lt;3 months in duration and 88 had a duration of ≥3 months. Those with shorter duration continuous headache were younger (median (interquartile range) 13.5 (11.1-15.7) vs. 15.1 (12.3-16.5) years, and less likely to have previously received a prescription preventive for the continuous headache (n = 14 (17%) vs. 26 (30%), p = 0.046), but were otherwise similar to those with NDPH in terms of baseline clinical and demographic variables. Sixty-five (74%) of those with NDPH and 60 (71%) with NOH had follow-up data. At last clinic follow-up, 41/65 (63%) with NDPH and 43/60 (72%) with NOH had experienced any headache benefit (<i>p</i> = 0.307), although 39/65 (60%) with NDPH and 29/60 (48%) with NOH still had continuous headache (<i>p</i> = 0.191). Headache duration was not associated with outcomes in multivariate regression modeling.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Headache outcomes of children and adolescents with new onset continuous headache, whether of 1 to &lt;3 months (NOH) or ≥3 months in duration (NDPH) are suboptimal. More research is needed to improve treatment outcomes for this patient population.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Szperka</LastName><ForeName>Christina L</ForeName><Initials>CL</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0003-4786-8889</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Pediatric Headache Program, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA.</Affiliation><Identifier Source="RINGGOLD">6567</Identifier></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Evans</LastName><ForeName>Morgan</ForeName><Initials>M</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Pediatric Headache Program, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA.</Affiliation><Identifier Source="RINGGOLD">6567</Identifier></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Patterson Gentile</LastName><ForeName>Carlyn</ForeName><Initials>C</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0003-4996-2457</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Pediatric Headache Program, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA.</Affiliation><Identifier Source="RINGGOLD">6567</Identifier></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Panigrahi</LastName><ForeName>Pratishtha</ForeName><Initials>P</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Pediatric Headache Program, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA.</Affiliation><Identifier Source="RINGGOLD">6567</Identifier></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Raj</LastName><ForeName>Nichelle R</ForeName><Initials>NR</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Pediatric Headache Program, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA.</Affiliation><Identifier Source="RINGGOLD">6567</Identifier></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Marquez de Prado</LastName><ForeName>Blanca</ForeName><Initials>B</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Pediatric Headache Program, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA.</Affiliation><Identifier Source="RINGGOLD">6567</Identifier></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Hershey</LastName><ForeName>Andrew D</ForeName><Initials>AD</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Cincinnatti Children's Hospital &amp;
