Multiple logistic regression examined the association of the pandemic with substance use after accounting for other factors.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Characteristics of the two cohorts were similar. Cannabis and sedative uses were not greatly different (28.8% vs 25.1%, and 8.3% vs 6.6%) but did reach statistical significance. Non-prescribed opioid use was double for the pandemic group (6.6% vs 3.3%). Alcohol use patterns were similar across the two cohorts. Measures of wellness were similar, while the pandemic group reported lower participation. The odds of use of cannabis, sedatives, and opioids were 1.3, 1.3, and 2.2 times greater, respectively, for the pandemic cohort after accounting for demographics, wellness, and participation. Greater use of non-prescribed opioids was reported during the pandemic in the South compared to prior to the pandemic (13.8% vs 6.1%).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The pandemic may have been associated with increased use of non-prescribed substances in the traumatic spinal cord injury population. Efforts to pursue longitudinal investigations would be warranted for definitive analysis of trends. The provision of demonstrably effective substance use treatment resources delivered via accessible methods will likely be needed in this population, particularly opioid treatment.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Chen</LastName><ForeName>Yuying</ForeName><Initials>Y</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Wen</LastName><ForeName>Huacong</ForeName><Initials>H</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Deutsch</LastName><ForeName>Anne</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, Chicago, Illinois, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>RTI International, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Botticello</LastName><ForeName>Amanda</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Kessler Foundation, Center for Outcomes and Assessment Research, West Orange, New Jersey, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Lo</LastName><ForeName>James G</ForeName><Initials>JG</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>HealthPartners Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Richards</LastName><ForeName>J Scott</ForeName><Initials>JS</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>11</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>England</Country><MedlineTA>J Spinal Cord Med</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>9504452</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1079-0268</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">COVID-19</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Substance use</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Traumatic spinal cord injury</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>11</Day><Hour>16</Hour><Minute>18</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>11</Day><Hour>16</Hour><Minute>18</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>11</Day><Hour>10</Hour><Minute>53</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39392454</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1080/10790268.2024.2400748</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
