Emerging VOCs, particularly omicron sub-lineages, show resistance to nAbs induced by prior infection or vaccination. The precise spike protein changes contributing to this resistance remain unclear in infectious cell culture systems. In the present study, a large panel of infectious SARS-CoV-2 mutant viruses, each with spike protein changes found in VOCs, including omicron JN.1 and its derivatives KP.2 and KP.3, was generated using a reverse genetic system. The susceptibility of these viruses to antibody neutralisation was measured using plasma from convalescent and vaccinated individuals. Synergistic roles of combined substitutions in the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) were observed in neutralisation resistance. However, recombinant viruses with the entire spike protein from a specific VOC showed enhanced resistance, indicating that changes outside the RBD are also significant. <i>In silico</i> analyses of spike antibody epitopes suggested changes in neutralisation could be due to altered antibody binding affinities. Assessing ACE2 usage for entry through anti-ACE2 antibody blocking and ACE2 siRNA revealed that omicron BA.2.86 and JN.1 mutant viruses were less dependent on ACE2 for entry. However, surface plasmon resonance analysis showed increased affinity for ACE2 for both BA.2.86 and JN.1 compared to the ancestral spike. This detailed analysis of specific changes in the SARS-CoV-2 spike enhances understanding of coronavirus evolution, particularly regarding neutralising antibody evasion and ACE2 entry receptor dependence.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Pham</LastName><ForeName>Long V</ForeName><Initials>LV</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Copenhagen
