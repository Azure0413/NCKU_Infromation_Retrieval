The potential for the media to influence public attitudes to vaccines is becoming increasingly crucial to address.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">To understand the differing roles and responsibilities in the communication of vaccine trials we draw insight from a retrospective study of 349 survey responses and 102 semi-structured interviews conducted in 2020 with participants in the United Kingdom's first-in-human clinical trial of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">We found that trial participants had mixed views as to whether their participation conferred responsibility to communicate more widely about their trial experiences. Some participants perceived themselves to have an altruistic obligation to communicate to the media about the trial, and others felt that those who did share their participation had 'attention-seeking' motives. When participants did speak out they preferred to do so anonymously. Frustration was also reported with sensationalised and false media stories. Social media was viewed as a means to accelerate misinformation or as a force for recruitment and public education about trials. Participants were pleased to see trial investigators and trial team playing prominent roles in the media and this instilled confidence in the vaccine and the trial. We discuss these evolving roles and responsibilities for trial communication, concentrating on the views of participants about experiences, opportunities, and risks.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">We argue that the pandemic has demonstrated the need for clinical trials to be made more transparent as a scientific practice that requires better public understanding and engagement. For high-profile vaccine trials we recommend; (1) explicit and comprehensive guidance aimed at all participants for interactions with the media; (2) prioritising having open and effectively expressed accounts of trial composition, processes, and participation; (3) offering support and a direct communication channel for journalists to report trials by utilising internal press officers to engage with journalists.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2024 The Authors.
