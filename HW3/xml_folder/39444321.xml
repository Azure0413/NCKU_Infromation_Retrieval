This study investigated the prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms in VAP, the VAP rate, and the outcomes associated with MDR-VAP.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">This retrospective single-center study, conducted in 2022, included adult ICU cases from April 2021 to March 2022, receiving mechanical ventilation for more than 48â€…h. Patient data were analyzed for demographics, comorbidities, empirical antibiotic use, and outcomes. MDR organisms were identified in respiratory cultures.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Among 447 patients, 133 developed VAP, with 96 cases being MDR-VAP. The mean age of the overall VAP population was 52 years, 70% of which were males. The incidence of VAP was 30.0% (95% CI: 25.7%-34.5%), while that of MDR-VAP was 21.6% (95% CI: 17.9%-25.8%). The most prevalent MDR organisms were Acinetobacter species (50%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (46.9%). Empirical antibiotics were administered in 96% of VAP cases. The overall VAP rate was 38.03/1000 ventilator days. No single antimicrobial agent seemed to offer an empirical cover, as the susceptibility rate for most tested antimicrobials was less than 85%. Patients with MDR-VAP had a low survival rate (64.6%) and were less likely to be extubated at 13.5% compared to non-MDR-VAP (survival rate of 62.2%). COVID-19 patients had a high incidence of MDR VAP, especially with Acinetobacter. Overall, VAP mortality was 57.1%. The median ventilator days were 16 for VAP and only four for non-VAP.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Gram-negative organisms, particularly Klebsiella and Acinetobacter, were the main MDR VAP culprits. MDR-VAP exhibited higher morbidity and mortality. A study focused on developing resistance by microorganisms is warranted for further understanding.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Mantri</LastName><ForeName>Tushar</ForeName><Initials>T</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, SQUH, Muscat, Oman.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Burad</LastName><ForeName>Jyoti</ForeName><Initials>J</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-6923-8557</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, SQUH, Muscat, Oman.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Hashmi</LastName><ForeName>Safiya Al</ForeName><Initials>SA</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Anesthesia, Oman Medical Specialty Board, Muscat, Oman.</Affiliation><Identifier Source="RINGGOLD">158419</Identifier></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Jaadi</LastName><ForeName>Said Salim Abood Al</ForeName><Initials>SSAA</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Anesthesia, Oman Medical Specialty Board, Muscat, Oman.</Affiliation><Identifier Source="RINGGOLD">158419</Identifier></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Aladawi</LastName><ForeName>Badriya</ForeName><Initials>B</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Microbiology, SQUH, Muscat, Oman.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Balushi</LastName><ForeName>Wijdan Abdullah Said</ForeName><Initials>WAS</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Anesthesia, Oman Medical Specialty Board, Muscat, Oman.</Affiliation><Identifier Source="RINGGOLD">158419</Identifier></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>24</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>J Intensive Care Med</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>8610344</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>0885-0666</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">COVID-19</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">antibiogram</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">antibiotics</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">multidrug resistance</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">ventilator-associated pneumonia</Keyword></KeywordList><CoiStatement>Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</CoiStatement></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>24</Day><Hour>16</Hour><Minute>21</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>24</Day><Hour>16</Hour><Minute>21</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>24</Day><Hour>3</Hour><Minute>52</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39444321</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1177/08850666241290468</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
