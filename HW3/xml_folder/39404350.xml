CP-COV03 is a novel antiviral candidate that significantly enhanced the bioavailability of niclosamide through inorganic-based drug delivery technology. The active pharmaceutical ingredient of CP-COV03, niclosamide, has been previously shown to possess broad-spectrum antiviral activity against over 30 different viruses in the <i>in vitro</i> tests. The aim of this study is to confirm the antiviral activity of CP-COV03 against the SFTSV in an <i>in vitro</i> model. Vero cells and SFTS viral stock NCCP43270, a 2015 Gangwon Province isolate, were used to obtain the 50% tissue culture infective dose of the virus. Vero cells seeded in 96-well plates were infected with SFTSV for 1 h. SFTSV-infected cells were treated with CP-COV03 at various concentrations of 0.1-100 μM and incubated for 7 days. On the seventh day of the culture, the cytopathic effect (CPE) of SFTSV was checked by microscopy and the cell viability was checked by using Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. The CPE reduced as the CP-COV03 concentration increased. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) range of CP-COV03 was below 0.125 µM, as determined from the viral titers of culture supernatants collected on the third day posttreatment of CP-COV03. The plaque reduction assay showed that the IC<sub>50</sub> of CP-COV03 was 1.893 µM, as determined from the percentage reduction of plaque counts for each drug concentration on the second day posttreatment with CP-COV03. This study suggests that CP-COV03 could be used as a potential antiviral agent for SFTS.IMPORTANCEWe demonstrated a concentration-dependent response and identified low a IC<sub>50</sub> of CP-COV03. This result is comparable to other antiviral drugs used against viruses like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature as our findings suggest that CP-COV03 may serve as a potential treatment for SFTS, highlighting its importance in the field of antiviral research.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author
