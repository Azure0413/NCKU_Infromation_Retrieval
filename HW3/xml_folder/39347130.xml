Overall, suicide trends remained relatively stable. Yet, specific age groups, races, and genders experienced an increase in suicide rates. A better understanding of suicide trends over time is critical to identifying and addressing mental health crises exacerbated by the pandemic. This study aimed to study whether the years preceding and during the pandemic were associated with an increase in emergency department (ED) visits in the United States for suicide or intentional injury.  Methodology Secondary analyses of data from the National Hospital and Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (2018-2021) were conducted. The frequency of ED visits due to intentional injury or suicide was compared in 2018-2019 (pre-COVID-19 pandemic onset) to those of 2020-2021 (during-COVID-19 onset). Logistic regression was used to estimate odd ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Patient's race, sex, age, and regional differences were assessed as covariates. Results There were 27,516 and 22,247 visits assessed in the pre- and during-COVID-19 periods, respectively. In total, 1,375 visits were due to intentional injury/suicide. No differences were found comparing the proportion of visits due to intentional injuries/suicide pre- and during-COVID-19 periods (2.6% in both) The adjusted OR (aOR) comparing pre- versus during-COVID-19 for emergency room visits due to intentional injury/suicide was not significantly different from 1 (aOR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.84-1.15). The odds of suicide/intentional injury were 53% higher in males (aOR = 1.53, 95%CI 1.30-1.81), in those with ages 18-44 years (aOR = 7.24, 95% CI 4.92-10.67) and 45-64 years (aOR = 3.55, 95% CI 2.31-5.47) compared to those 65 years or older, and in non-Hispanic Black individuals compared to non-Hispanic White individuals (aOR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.05-1.58).  Conclusions Using a national sample of ED visits, we found no association between the pre- and COVID-19 pandemic periods and the proportion of visits due to intentional injury/suicide. However, the study's proportional prevalence design limits its ability to estimate actual risk, requiring a cautious interpretation of the findings. Despite these limitations, the observed increased odds of suicide or intentional injury in specific subgroups underscore the need for targeted interventions. Further research is crucial to assess the long-term impacts of COVID-19.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024, Litenski et al.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Litenski</LastName><ForeName>Melissa N</ForeName><Initials>MN</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Medical School Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health, Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, Miami, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Shtanko</LastName><ForeName>Yulia</ForeName><Initials>Y</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Medical School Department of General Surgery, Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, Miami, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>O'Reardon</LastName><ForeName>Aoife B</ForeName><Initials>AB</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Medical School Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health, Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, Miami, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Castro</LastName><ForeName>Grettel</ForeName><Initials>G</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Medical and Population Health Sciences Research, Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, Miami, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Castellanos</LastName><ForeName>Daniel</ForeName><Initials>D</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychiatry, Creighton University School of Medicine, Phoenix, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Varella</LastName><ForeName>Marcia</ForeName><Initials>M</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Medical and Population Health Sciences Research, Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, Miami, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>08</Month><Day>30</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>Cureus</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101596737</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>2168-8184</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">coronavirus pandemic</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">covid-19</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">emergency department visits</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">intentional injury</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">public mental health</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">suicide attempt</Keyword></KeywordList><CoiStatement>Human subjects: Consent was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
