The data were collected through online cross-sectional surveys of Australian caregivers' intention to vaccinate their children against influenza in 2017 and 2023. The proportion of parents who intended to vaccinate their children against influenza was weighted to reflect Australia's population distribution. We compared this to National Centre for Immunisation Research Surveillance (NCIRS) data on the percentage (%) of children registered as actually having had the influenza vaccine in 2017 and 2023.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">In children aged five years and under, an increase in intention to vaccinate of 34.7 percentage points from 27.4% (weighted, n = 307/1050) in 2017 to 62.1% (weighted, n = 457/743) in 2023 was observed. We compared intention with the NCIRS influenza vaccine uptake data, which recorded an increased uptake for children under five years of 23.3 percentage points from 6.2% in 2017 to 28.2% in 2023.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Between 2017 and 2023, there was a substantial increase in caregiver intention to vaccinate children against influenza, during which the national free influenza vaccine policy for young children was enacted and the COVID-19 pandemic began. There is a substantial gap between the intention to vaccinate and actual uptake of influenza vaccination, warranting further investigation into the barriers behind vaccination, beyond that of cost.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024 The Authors.
