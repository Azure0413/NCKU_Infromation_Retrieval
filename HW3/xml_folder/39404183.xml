The experimental group received olfactory training with TCM aromatics (ginger, Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae, Santali Albi Lignum, Styrax), while the control group used non-TCM aromatics (phenyl ethanol-rose, menthol-mint, citronellal-lemon, eugenol-clove) for 24 weeks. Olfactory function was assessed using the Sniffin' Sticks test and TDI (threshold-discrimination-identification) scores at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months post-treatment.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Response rates at 1, 3, and 6 months post-treatment were 3.66%, 25.61%, and 43.90% in the experimental group, and 4.94%, 23.46%, and 43.21% in the control group. The TDI scores of the experimental group and the control group were statistically different before and after treatment. At 3 and 6 months post-treatment, TDI scores increased significantly, with enhanced odor discrimination and identification capabilities in both groups compared to pre-treatment, while the odor detection threshold was not improved compared with that before treatment. At the 3- and 6-month follow-ups, experimental group showed significantly higher self-rated sleep and anxiety scores than controls, indicating notable improvement in both after treatment.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Olfactory training with aromatic TCM offers an effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2-induced olfactory dysfunction, improving odor discrimination, identification without significant differences compared to conventional aromatics, besides, it may also improve anxiety and sleep quality.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Qiao</LastName><ForeName>X-F</ForeName><Initials>XF</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Shanxi Provincial People's Hospital Affiliated to Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Han</LastName><ForeName>L-Y</ForeName><Initials>LY</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Graduate School, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Li</LastName><ForeName>Y-F</ForeName><Initials>YF</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Graduate School, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Li</LastName><ForeName>H</ForeName><Initials>H</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Graduate School, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Zhen</LastName><ForeName>H-M</ForeName><Initials>HM</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Graduate School, Shanxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Taiyuan, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Dang</LastName><ForeName>H-R</ForeName><Initials>HR</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Graduate School, Shanxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Taiyuan, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Chen</LastName><ForeName>Y</ForeName><Initials>Y</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Shanxi Provincial People's Hospital Affiliated to Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Li</LastName><ForeName>X</ForeName><Initials>X</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Surgery, Children's Hospital of Shanxi Province, Taiyuan, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>15</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>Netherlands</Country><MedlineTA>Rhinology</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>0347242</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>0300-0729</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>15</Day><Hour>16</Hour><Minute>19</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>15</Day><Hour>16</Hour><Minute>19</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>15</Day><Hour>8</Hour><Minute>33</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39404183</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.4193/Rhin24.035</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="pii">3236</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
