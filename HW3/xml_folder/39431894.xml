Probiotic supplementation has shown promise in reducing the nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load, diminishing symptom frequency and duration, and mitigating inflammation; thus, it is a potential strategy for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we evaluated the effects of the oral administration of the <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> GUANKE strain, a gram-positive bacterium originally isolated from a healthy individual, on SARS-CoV-2 infection in a human ACE2 transgenic mouse model. We found that GUANKE significantly reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and pulmonary interstitial exudation in mice. The transcription of <i>CCL2</i>, <i>TNFA</i>, <i>IL1B</i>, <i>IL6,</i> and <i>IL17C</i> in the lungs was reduced. The protein levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-17 in the lungs were significantly lower in GUANKE-treated mice than in control mice. The viral load in GUANKE-treated mice was lower than that in saline-treated mice, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. <i>L. plantarum</i> GUANKE can decrease SARS-CoV-2-induced lung inflammation in mice, suggesting its potential for use as an agent for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="IMPORTANCE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">Most otherwise healthy individuals develop only mild or moderate symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by current strains of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and virus replication is mainly confined to the upper respiratory tract; however, the virus can infect the lower respiratory tract and promote inflammation. Probiotic supplementation has been shown to reduce nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load, reduce the overall number and duration of symptoms, and attenuate inflammation in clinical trials. We showed that a novel <i>L. plantarum</i> GUANKE strain alleviated SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia in mice. The transcription and production of inflammatory cytokines were suppressed, and GUANKE moderately reduced the viral load. <i>L. plantarum</i> GUANKE has the potential to become a candidate drug for the treatment of COVID-19 or other viral respiratory infections.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y" EqualContrib="Y"><LastName>Huang</LastName><ForeName>He</ForeName><Initials>H</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-4887-2671</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>NHC Key Laboratory of System Biology of Pathogens and Christophe Mérieux Laboratory, National Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences &amp;
