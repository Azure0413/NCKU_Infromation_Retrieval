Though many studies exist that focus on physician and nurse well-being, few have specifically identified stressors that affect professionals working within the end-of-life interdisciplinary team. The primary objective of this study was to expand research on moral distress and clinician well-being to include healthcare professionals working with patients with chronic and life-limiting illnesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey approach was used with 110 professionals working within one hospital network's palliative and hospice team to identify key indicators of moral distress (using the MMD-HP scale) and professional well-being during the pandemic. Quantitative and qualitative analysis was completed to determine themes related to moral distress and professional well-being. Numerous themes were identified, including the importance of caseload, general support, team support, management, and professional flexibility. Additional end-of-life themes were identified, including the impact of death, lack of personal protective equipment, fear of transmitting the virus, COVID disbelief, and the inability of clinicians and/or family to be with patients in person. From the experience participants had during COVID-19, four areas of change were identified: professional resilience, management/ethics support, professional development, and physical and emotional safety.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Sherman</LastName><ForeName>Jillian</ForeName><Initials>J</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Riverside Methodist Hospital, OhioHealth, Columbus, Ohio.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Petros</LastName><ForeName>Shannon</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Riverside Methodist Hospital, OhioHealth, Columbus, Ohio.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>03</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>J Soc Work End Life Palliat Care</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101235219</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1552-4264</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">COVID</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">MMD-HP</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">hospice</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">moral distress</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">palliative</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>4</Day><Hour>7</Hour><Minute>19</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>4</Day><Hour>7</Hour><Minute>19</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>3</Day><Hour>12</Hour><Minute>52</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39361512</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1080/15524256.2024.2404461</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
