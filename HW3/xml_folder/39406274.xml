The role of smoking as a significant contributing factor to male infertility has been substantiated. Does the combined effect of smoking and SARS-CoV-2 infection impact male reproductive function? A prospective descriptive cohort study was performed using data from 90 smoking and 90 non-smoking males before and after coronavirus infection in a single center over a period of 3 months. Semen samples were collected before and within 15 days after COVID-19 infection, ensuring no more than three months elapsed between the two collections. The semen parameters evaluated included volume, concentration, progressive motility, normal morphology, and DNA fragmentation rate. Proteomic and metabolomic studies were further used to explore the differences between groups. Both non-smokers and smokers exhibited a marked reduction in sperm concentration, progressive motility, and normal morphology rate. Additionally, an increase in sperm DNA fragmentation index was noted for non-smokers and smokers. In the non-smoking group, dysregulation proteins including SEMG1, SEMG2 and DNAH5, and metabolites including L-glutamine, cis-9-Palmitoleic acid and Linoleamide were observed. In smokers, dysregulation proteins including SMCP, ROPN1B and IZUMO4, alongside metabolites including carnitine, gamma-Glutamylglutamic acid, and hypoxanthine were found. Comparative analysis between smoking and non-smoking patients post-COVID-19 also revealed significant differences in semen concentration, morphology and sperm DNA fragmentation rate. Dysregulated proteins including HSPA5, HSPA2 and PGK2, and metabolites such as acetylcarnitine, oxaloacetate and nicotinate were associated with impaired sperm function. Our study demonstrates that the virus also significantly compromises sperm quality in smoking males, who experience more pronounced declines post-infection compared to their non-smoking counterparts. This research underscores the necessity for comprehensive fertility assessments for smoking males after recovering from COVID-19.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc.
