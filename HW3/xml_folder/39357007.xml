Challenges implementing WBS included political will and realized value, funding, understanding the building architecture, and the need for details in the findings. <b>Conclusions.</b> WBS has been effective for detecting outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in different sized jails, those with both dorm- and cell-based architectural design. <b>Public Health Implications.</b> Given its effectiveness in monitoring SARS-CoV-2, WBS provides a model for population-based surveillance in carceral facilities for future infectious disease outbreaks.
