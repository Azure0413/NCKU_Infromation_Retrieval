This study explores the significance of respiratory infectious disease prevention and control systems worldwide, particularly during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The epidemiology of many respiratory diseases such as influenza changed over the past two years, and the incidence of pathogens such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis has also increased. Based on influenza surveillance data in China, the influenza season in 2023 was notably delayed and extended, with A(H1N1) pdm09 being the predominant strain. This editorial also reviewed the gradual establishment of China's infectious disease prevention and control system following the 2003 SARS outbreak, highlighting the role of medical facilities in managing public health emergencies, conducting infectious disease pre-screening, and reporting cases to networks in real time. In the future, China will further develop an intelligent, multi-trigger infectious disease surveillance and early warning system to increase the early detection of unknown infectious diseases and optimize the allocation of medical resources. A robust infectious disease control system is crucial to addressing future pandemic threats.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Li</LastName><ForeName>Xiaohe</ForeName><Initials>X</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>National Clinical Research Centre for Infectious Diseases, The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen and The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Han</LastName><ForeName>Bing</ForeName><Initials>B</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Beijing Quality Control and Improvement Center of Infectious Diseases, Beijing, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Chen</LastName><ForeName>Yafan</ForeName><Initials>Y</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>National Clinical Research Centre for Infectious Diseases, The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen and The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Health Science Center, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Lu</LastName><ForeName>Hongzhou</ForeName><Initials>H</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>National Clinical Research Centre for Infectious Diseases, The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen and The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>17</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>Japan</Country><MedlineTA>Biosci Trends</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101502754</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1881-7815</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">infectious disease surveillance</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">influenza</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">respiratory infectious disease</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">respiratory infectious disease prevention and control system</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>17</Day><Hour>10</Hour><Minute>2</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>17</Day><Hour>10</Hour><Minute>2</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>16</Day><Hour>21</Hour><Minute>54</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39414464</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.5582/bst.2024.01197</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
