We explored SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid diagnostic test acceptability and positivity in community settings in Cameroon. In August-October 2022, community workers sensitized and referred individuals for COVID-19 testing to nearby testing points in Douala and Yaoundé. Participants consented to SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid diagnostic testing, a survey, or both components. We describe the positivity rate, COVID-19-related history, and Likert-scale testing perceptions. Factors associated with testing acceptance were analyzed using logistic regression. Overall, 20.5% (2,449/11,945) of sensitized individuals visited testing points, and 1,864 (76.1%) were enrolled; 50.6% accepted the survey and testing (46.0% accepted survey only). Seven (0.7%) of 1,006 individuals tested positive. Most (71.8%; 1,292/1,800) considered community testing more accessible than hospital-based testing. Individuals accepting versus refusing testing differed in perceived COVID-19 risk (67%, 49%; P &lt;0.001), belief in accurate test results (79%, 47%; P &lt;0.001), and ability to test easily (96%, 55%; P &lt;0.001). Males (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.26 [1.04-1.53]) and those over 50 years (aOR: 1.9 [1.4-2.7]), with symptoms (aOR: 1.80 [1.30-2.50]), and at least partial vaccination (aOR: 0.76 [0.58-0.99]) were significantly associated with test acceptance. Refusal reasons included lack of perceived need for testing (33.8%) and testing discomfort (26.3%). Although community-based testing was generally perceived as important, actual testing uptake was low. In future pandemics, community testing should be optimized by addressing misinformation, offering alternative testing modalities for greater comfort, creating demand, and tailoring approaches to maximize testing uptake.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Djikeussi</LastName><ForeName>Tatiana
