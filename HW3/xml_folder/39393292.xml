Currently, there is a lack of analysis of MTB fractures based on emergency department (ED) data obtained on a national scale. It was hypothesized that the total number of fractures presenting to United States (US) EDs increased significantly over the last decade, and adult male riders experienced higher rates of fracture and fracture-related hospitalization than other demographics.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">All data was extracted from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), a public database representing approximately 100 US EDs. NEISS was queried for all MTB-related fractures from January 1st, 2013-December 31, 2022.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">NEISS returned a national estimate (NE) of 35,260 MTB fractures visiting EDs between 2013 and 2022. Fracture injuries increased significantly over the study period, including a 247 % increase from 2019 to 2020. The mechanism of injury most likely resulting in fracture was being thrown from the bike (39.6 %, NE:5,436). The upper extremity was the most commonly fractured body region (32.8 %, NE:11,574), and trunk fractures had the highest rate of hospitalization (44.2 %, NE:3705). Males accounted for the majority of fractures (87.9 %, NE:30,996), and were more likely to be hospitalized than females (22.2 %&gt;17.4 %). Adults (age≥40) were more likely to sustain a fracture (48.8 %) and be hospitalized because of it (25.8 %) than other age groups. Adults were also most likely to fracture their trunk (33.9 %).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">MTB fractures increased significantly from 2013 to 2022, possibly due to the gaining popularity of MTB since COVID-19. The upper extremity was the most frequently fractured body region, and being thrown from the bike was the mechanism most likely to result in a fracture. Adult male riders are at a high risk for trunk fractures, demonstrating the importance of protective equipment such as chest and torso protectors for these athletes.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="LEVEL OF EVIDENCE" NlmCategory="METHODS">III.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
