Data from patients treated between 2018 to February 2020 (before the Covid-19 pandemic) were compared with data from patients treated between March 2020 and March 2022 (during the Covid-19 pandemic) and between April 2022 and February 2023 (after the Covid-19 pandemic).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">No differences in terms of main pathologic features were observed in patients undergoing RP, RNU, orchifunicolectomy, or circumcision and/or penectomy. Further a lower pathological tumor stage were diagnosed for RN after the Covid-19 pandemic (p&amp;lt;0.05). A higher age at diagnosis for penile cancer was observed during the pandemic cohort in comparison to the pre-Covid-19 pandemic cohort (p&amp;lt;0.05), but this did not translate into a worse pathological stage or lymph node involvement. Another notable change was the shortening of the length of stay (LOS) for orchifunicolectomy over the pandemic (p&amp;lt;0.05).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Neither decline in uro-oncologic activity nor pathological features were observed at our institution before, during and after the Covid-19 pandemic. A significantly lower pathological tumor stage for RN after the Covid-19 pandemic was seen. Penile cancer was diagnosed at a significantly higher age during the Covid-19 pandemic, and a decrease in LOS for orchifunicolectomy was observed.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>The Author(s).
