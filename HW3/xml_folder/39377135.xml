The purpose of this study was to investigate the trends of pickleball-related Achilles tendon injuries.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">A retrospective case series was performed to determine the trends associated with pickleball-related Achilles tendon injuries over the last 10 years. A database search of all Achilles tendon ruptures (ICD-10 S86.0) presenting to a large, multistate, subspecialty referral orthopaedic clinic between January 2013 and June 2023 were identified and included in the study. Pickleball-related injuries were identified via query and confirmed with manual chart review. The incidence of pickleball-related injuries, as well as patient demographics and rate of surgery was determined and compared with the total population during that time period.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">A total of 2684 patients who suffered an Achilles tendon injury between January 2013 and June 2023 were identified, with 43 patients meeting the inclusion criteria for pickleball-related Achilles tendon ruptures. The number and overall incidence of pickleball-related Achilles tendon injuries has been increasing since 2016, excluding 2020 where there was a large decrease likely due to the COVID-19 epidemic. Pickleball was associated with older age at time of injury (64.5 vs 48.6, P &lt; .001) as well as a lower BMI (26.6 vs 29.4, P &lt; .001). In addition, patients who sustained a pickleball-related Achilles tendon injury were more likely to undergo surgery (67.4% vs 45.4%, P = .008).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The rising popularity of pickleball and its associated injuries poses a significant risk to the aging population, with Achilles tendon injuries occurring in older individuals and resulting in a higher likelihood of undergoing surgery.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="LEVEL OF EVIDENCE" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED"><i>IV; retrospective case-series</i>.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>McCahon</LastName><ForeName>Joseph A S</ForeName><Initials>JAS</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-6655-5581</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Jefferson Health-New Jersey, Stratford, New Jersey.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Miller</LastName><ForeName>Mark</ForeName><Initials>M</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Jefferson Health-New Jersey, Stratford, New Jersey.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Riebesell</LastName><ForeName>Samantha</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Rothman Orthopaedic Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Pedowitz</LastName><ForeName>David I</ForeName><Initials>DI</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Rothman Orthopaedic Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Parekh</LastName><ForeName>Selene G</ForeName><Initials>SG</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Rothman Orthopaedic Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Daniel</LastName><ForeName>Joseph N</ForeName><Initials>JN</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Rothman Orthopaedic Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>08</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>Foot Ankle Spec</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101473598</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1938-6400</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Achilles tendon</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Achilles tendon ruptures</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">pickleball</Keyword></KeywordList><CoiStatement>Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</CoiStatement></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>8</Day><Hour>7</Hour><Minute>3</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>8</Day><Hour>7</Hour><Minute>3</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>8</Day><Hour>5</Hour><Minute>3</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39377135</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1177/19386400241286591</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
