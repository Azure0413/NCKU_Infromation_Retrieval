This article highlights her career, beginning with her medical education at Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore, where she embarked on her groundbreaking research in enteric diseases, particularly rotavirus, a major cause of child mortality globally. Over the course of her distinguished career, she has led groundbreaking research on rotavirus, contributing to the development of two WHO-approved vaccines tailored for Indian communities: Rotavac (Bharat Biotech, Hyderabad, India) and Rotasiil (Serum Institute of India, Pune, India). Beyond her research, Dr. Kang has held significant advisory roles on national and global platforms, including WHO's Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). She has authored over 300 scientific publications and coauthored the bestselling book "Till We Win," which details India's fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Her exceptional contributions have earned her numerous accolades, including the Infosys Prize in Life Sciences, the Fellowship of the Royal Society, and the Canada Gairdner Global Health Award. Dr. Kang's career exemplifies her dedication to advancing public health, vaccine development, and global health initiatives, making her a trailblazer in the field of microbiology and virology.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024, Balaji et al.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Balaji</LastName><ForeName>Lavanya</ForeName><Initials>L</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Microbiology, Saveetha Medical College and Hospitals, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Saveetha University, Chennai, IND.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Ramanan</LastName><ForeName>Lavanya</ForeName><Initials>L</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Microbiology, Saveetha Medical College and Hospitals, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Saveetha University, Chennai, IND.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Easwaran</LastName><ForeName>Subbalakshmi</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Microbiology, Saveetha Medical College and Hospitals, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Saveetha University, Chennai, IND.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType><PublicationType UI="D016454">Review</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>09</Month><Day>25</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>Cureus</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101596737</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>2168-8184</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">gagandeep kang</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">historical vignette</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">public and environmental health</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">rotavirus vaccine</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">vaccine godmother</Keyword></KeywordList><CoiStatement>Conflicts of interest: In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following: Payment/services info: All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.
