The literature search database and review period were determined after verification of validity by five experts (nursing professors). The inclusion criteria for the literature review were that the paper must be written in English, and the abstract or title of the paper should have included attributes of nursing students' resilience. Exclusion criteria were papers written in languages other than English, papers that did not include the attributes of resilience of nursing students, and duplicate papers. Seventeen studies were included in the analysis.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Resilience among nursing students comprised three attributes and 28 sub-attributes. The three attributes were individual, educational, and situational. Individual attributes included personal competency characteristics (e.g., self-confidence and self-efficacy) and consisted of 15 sub-attributes. Educational attributes included characteristics related to academic and clinical practicum (e.g., coping with academic work pressure) and consisted of seven sub-attributes. Situational attributes comprised characteristics that changed according to circumstances (e.g., coping with increased levels of patient acuity during the crisis), such as the COVID-19 pandemic and social support from significant others, and consisted of six sub-attributes.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">This study identified resilience attributes reflecting the characteristics of nursing students and recent situational changes. Consequently, tools to assess resilience should be developed based on study findings and utilized in various studies aimed at enhancing the resilience of nursing students.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
