Some of these challenges were pertinent to biological factors, like the risk of infection, while others resulted from social factors, like ageism and government regulations. Employing a capability approach, this study examined how age-based pandemic regulations that were imposed in Turkey affected the freedom and social environment of older adults. We used Bachhi's What is the Problem Represented to Be? (WPR) approach to analyze the memorandums issued by the central government between March 11, 2020, and June 30, 2021. Our analysis revealed that the problem is represented in these memorandums as older people's increased vulnerability to health risks, which resulted in violations of their mobility and health capabilities, as well as (mis)recognition of diversity within the older population. These findings provide vital insight into how age-based pandemic regulations define the problem based exclusively on chronological age, thereby creating circumstances that compromise older people's capabilities beyond simply maintaining health. Thus, we recommend that policymakers pay closer attention to both the intended and unintended consequences of any proposed regulations, and account for individuals' <i>capabilities</i> rather than merely their <i>functionings.</i></AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Con Wright</LastName><ForeName>Gülçin</ForeName><Initials>G</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0001-7196-151X</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Assistant Professor, Faculty of Arts &amp; Sciences, Sociology Department, TED University, Ankara, Turkey.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Özdemir Ocaklı</LastName><ForeName>Burcu</ForeName><Initials>B</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-9027-2880</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Associate Professor, Faculty of Health Sciences, Department Social Work, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Associate Professor, Center on Ageing Studies Implementation and Research, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>07</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>England</Country><MedlineTA>J Aging Soc Policy</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>8914669</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>0895-9420</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">COVID-19 pandemic</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Capabilities</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Turkey</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">lockdowns</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">older adults</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>7</Day><Hour>22</Hour><Minute>18</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>7</Day><Hour>22</Hour><Minute>18</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>7</Day><Hour>15</Hour><Minute>13</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39374406</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1080/08959420.2024.2403827</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
