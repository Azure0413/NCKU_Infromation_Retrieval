Data collected in England during 2019-23.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Two modes of commissioning operated in parallel. Commodified commissioning relied on creating a principal-agent relationship between commissioner and the voluntary, community and social enterprises, on formal competitive selection ('procurement') of providers. Collaborative commissioning relied on 'embedded' interorganisational relationships, mutual recognition of resource dependencies, a negotiated division of labour between organisations, and control through persuasion. Commissioners and voluntary, community and social enterprises often worked around the procurement regulations. Both modes were present everywhere but the balance depended inter alia on the number and size of voluntary, community and social enterprises in each locality, their past commissioning experience, the character of the tracer activity, and the level of deprivation and the geographic dispersal of the populations served. The COVID-19 pandemic produced a shift towards collaborative commissioning. Voluntary, community and social enterprises were not always funded at the full cost of their activity. Integrated Care System formation temporarily disrupted local co-commissioning networks but offered a longer-term prospect of greater voluntary, community and social enterprise influence on co-commissioning. To develop absorptive capacity, commissioners needed stronger managerial and communication capabilities, and voluntary, community and social enterprises needed greater capability to evidence what outcomes their proposals would deliver.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="LIMITATIONS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Published data quality limited the spending profile accuracy, which did not include local authority commissioning. Case studies did not cover London, and focused on three tracer activities. Absorptive capacity survey was not a random sample.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The two modes of commissioning sometimes conflicted. Workarounds arose from organisations' embeddedness and collaboration, which the procurement regulations often disrupted.

This study aimed to explore how commissioners and voluntary, community and social enterprises worked together and where improvements could be made. We talked to commissioners and voluntary, community and social enterprises in six areas across England and focused on services for learning disabilities, social prescribing and end-of-life care. We analysed National Health Service financial accounts to see how much the National Health Service was spending on services provided by voluntary, community and social enterprises. We surveyed how commissioners and voluntary, community and social enterprises were using information and knowledge to make decisions. We organised events bringing together commissioners and voluntary, community and social enterprises to share knowledge and experience. We found there were two ways commissioners bought services from voluntary, community and social enterprises. One was commodified (a buying-and-selling model), the other collaborative (based on working together). Both were happening at the same time in all the areas of the study, but usually one of them was more present than the other. We saw a general move towards collaboration, but some areas were further along with this than others. Various things helped commissioners and voluntary, community and social enterprises collaborate, such as: paying voluntary, community and social enterprises enough for their services; having people and networks that encouraged others to work with voluntary, community and social enterprises; and including voluntary, community and social enterprises in making decisions about health and care. Commissioners and voluntary, community and social enterprises might therefore lean further towards working together to see how collaborative commissioning can be further developed; how to make contract prices cover voluntary, community and social enterprises’ costs; how to enable longer-term contracts; and how to enable less hurried, more considered ways of renewing contracts (e.g. by putting draft contract specifications out to pre-tender consultation). The new Integrated Care Systems in local areas could encourage all this to happen, but pressures elsewhere in the health and care sector might make it more difficult.</AbstractText></OtherAbstract><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">COVID-19</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDIES</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">PATIENT AND PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">PERSUASIVE COMMUNICATION</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">POLICY</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">SOCIALISED MEDICINE</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">STATE MEDICINE</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>4</Day><Hour>12</Hour><Minute>44</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>4</Day><Hour>12</Hour><Minute>43</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>4</Day><Hour>9</Hour><Minute>53</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>ppublish</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39365145</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.3310/NTDT7965</ArticleId></ArticleIdList><ReferenceList><Reference><Citation>Gadsby EW, Peckham S, Coleman A, Bramwell D, Perkins N, Jenkins LM.
