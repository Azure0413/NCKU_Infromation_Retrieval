To create a quick reference infographic bringing together experiential evidence on the range and considerations regarding different modes of practice for use by the school nursing community of practice.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="DESIGN" NlmCategory="METHODS">A descriptive qualitative secondary data analysis of open-ended questions in a survey, and focus groups with school nurses. The pragmatic aim was to focus on changes in school nurse modes of practice to ensure continued engagement with children and young people, and school nurses' experience of the benefits and challenges of these modes of practice.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Data were collected from 98 school nurse participants across a United Kingdom-wide survey (n78) in April to May 2022, and focus groups (n20) in June to July 2022, within the School Nursing in the Time of COVID project. Data from the seven open-ended questions in the survey and four questions from the focus group were analysed using the framework approach.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Modes of practice fell into two categories: individual assessment and support (video-calling platforms, telephone contact, virtual messaging, walk-and-talks and home visits) and group support (wellbeing approaches, social media). Considerations for these modes rooted in school nurses' experience are described. Interpretations were used to create the summarising evidence-based infographic as a quick reference resource for school nurses.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">There was no 'one size fits all' approach. The modes used by school nurses were adopted or developed out of necessity or resource availability and in response to the specific needs of individuals or groups. The developed infographic provides a quick reference guide to deliver the expressed need for knowledge exchange within the school nursing community by participants in the original studies and can be used to inform current school nurse practice.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PROFESSION AND/OR PATIENT CARE" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The developed evidence-based infographic has stand-alone value. It has the potential to raise awareness of the range of different strategies that can be used to facilitate and/or enhance engagement with children and young people, equip school nurses with knowledge to foster innovative and responsive practice and aid critical reflection in a complex post-pandemic landscape. The infographic is a unique resource and is a first step in knowledge exchange based on experiential learning. The resource will be used as the foundation for future work to develop a co-created training resource for school nurse students (undertaking the Specialist Community Public Health Nurses course) and/or continuing professional development resource for established school nurses.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="REPORTING METHOD" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">This study has been conducted and reported in accordance with COREQ guidelines for qualitative research.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A consultation group was closely involved with the planning, conduct and analysis of the original studies. This group consisted of representatives from professional organisations SAPHNA (School and Public Health Nurses Association) and the CPHVA (Community Practitioners' and Health Visitors' Association), a school nurse and a member of the public. SAPHNA have continued in their consultative role for this study and has provided content and usability feedback regarding the infographic. Early findings have been presented to the SN community of practice, and feedback invited, through presentation separately at the CPHVA and SAPHNA annual conference.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© 2024 The Author(s).
