Mortality was assessed up to 24 months following incidence date. Expected numbers of incident cases and all-cause deaths during the pandemic were estimated using Poisson regression models and survival was analyzed using Cox regressions.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The database included 397,092 incident lung cancer cases in total, 20 % of whom underwent thoracic surgery. During the first pandemic wave (March-June 2020), there were 12 % i.e., 1940 fewer incident lung cancer cases than the expected figure (16,325), while no significant difference was found thereafter. Survival at 6 and 24 months improved steadily from 2013 to 2019 and continued to improve during pandemic years 2020-2021. However, during the first wave, a slight excess mortality was observed compared with predictions based on pre-pandemic trends.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The lower incidence observed during the first wave with no catch-up in the following periods could be explained by deaths among yet undiagnosed patients, either from COVID-19 or as a result of barriers to accessing healthcare. The excess mortality observed for both operated and non-operated patients may be attributable to delayed diagnosis, as well as to COVID-19-related deaths.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024 The Authors.
