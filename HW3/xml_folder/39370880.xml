The COVID-19 pandemic has had widespread effects on various aspects of life, including the food supply chain, potentially impacting the incidence of foodborne diseases. This study aims to analyze the differences between notified and diagnosed cases and investigate the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on foodborne diseases in the metropolitan area of Bologna, Italy.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A retrospective time trend analysis from two databases was conducted.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The Local Health Authority of Bologna collected data re/Emilia-Romagna Region on the infectious disease reporting system over a six-year period (2017-2022), which included three years of the COVID-19 pandemic. This data was compared with information collected during the same period at the microbiology laboratory serving the entire metropolitan area of Bologna. Statistical methods included percent change calculations, binomial tests, annual averages, gender and age stratification, and trend analysis with regression.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">An increase (+34.4%, P-value â‰¤ 0.01) in notified cases during the pandemic - compared to the pre-pandemic period - was found. However, no differences were observed in diagnosed cases when comparing the two periods. The year 2021 saw a significant increase in reported cases of foodborne diseases among schoolers (+300.0%) and workers (+133.3%) compared to 2020. On the other hand, diagnosed cases decreased significantly in 2020 (-19.1%, P&lt;0.01) and increased in 2021 (+21.9%, P&lt;0.01). In absolute terms, a stark difference was observed between notified and diagnosed cases across all the study years (2017-2022).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">This study highlights the discrepancy between notified and diagnosed cases of foodborne diseases and how the COVID-19 pandemic has increased reporting without affecting transmission. These findings contribute to the ongoing discussion on improving foodborne disease reporting systems.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Capodici</LastName><ForeName>Angelo</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Section of Hygiene and Preventive Medicine, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Italy.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Interdisciplinary Research Center for Health Science, Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies, Pisa, Tuscany, Italy.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Lenzi</LastName><ForeName>Jacopo</ForeName><Initials>J</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Italy.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Cavagnis</LastName><ForeName>Sara</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Section of Hygiene and Preventive Medicine, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Italy.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Ricci</LastName><ForeName>Matteo</ForeName><Initials>M</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Section of Hygiene and Preventive Medicine, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Italy.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>De Dominicis</LastName><ForeName>Francesco</ForeName><Initials>F</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Section of Hygiene and Preventive Medicine, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Italy.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Ambretti</LastName><ForeName>Simone</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Microbiology Unit, IRCCS Joint University-Hospital Trust, Bologna, Italy.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences (DIMEC), Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Italy.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Gabrielli</LastName><ForeName>Liliana</ForeName><Initials>L</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Microbiology Unit, IRCCS Joint University-Hospital Trust, Bologna, Italy.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Galli</LastName><ForeName>Silvia</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Microbiology Unit, IRCCS Joint University-Hospital Trust, Bologna, Italy.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Lazzarotto</LastName><ForeName>Tiziana</ForeName><Initials>T</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Microbiology Unit, IRCCS Joint University-Hospital Trust, Bologna, Italy.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences (DIMEC), Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Italy.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Resi</LastName><ForeName>Davide</ForeName><Initials>D</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Public Health, Bologna Local Health Authority, Bologna, Italy.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>05</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>Italy</Country><MedlineTA>Ann Ig</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>9002865</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1120-9135</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Foodborne Diseases; Notification of Infectious Diseases; COVID-19 pandemic</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>7</Day><Hour>10</Hour><Minute>18</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>7</Day><Hour>10</Hour><Minute>18</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>7</Day><Hour>4</Hour><Minute>2</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39370880</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.7416/ai.2024.2656</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
