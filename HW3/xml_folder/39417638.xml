In order to biobank DBS samples, an understanding of the preservation of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is needed. Therefore, we assessed the stability of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on DBS during short- and long-term storage under different storage temperatures. Seven sample donors were enrolled, each donating twenty 6 mm DBS to assess anti-spike (S1) SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (EUROIMMUN). Baseline samples were analyzed on the day of collection. The remainder of the samples was stored in grip seal bags kept in a cryobox at room temperature/4°C until 2 months after collection and at -20°C until 2 years after collection. Samples were analyzed at regular intervals within the total storage duration and after one and five freeze-thaw cycles. A pooled coefficient of variation was calculated for each storage temperature. We found that anti-S1 SARS-CoV-2 antibodies collected on DBS saver cards remain stable during short-term storage at RT, 4°C, and -20°C (at least to 2 months) and long-term storage at -20°C (at least 2 years). Moreover, up to five freeze-thaw cycles can occur without impacting the anti-S1 SARS-CoV-2 antibody level. The inter-assay coefficient of variation lies between 10 and 15%. As DBS can be preserved for both shorter periods of time at RT and longer periods of time at -20°C, they are a perfect application for studies that require sample shipment by mail, self-sampling studies, studies in limited resource settings and biobanking.IMPORTANCEDried blood spots (DBS) are currently widely used as a microsampling technique for different qualitative and quantitative serological assessments. Yet, there is a lack of long-term stability and storage condition studies. In our study, first, we assessed the stability of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on DBS up to 2 years post-collection. We believe that our data are not only important for future COVID-19 research but also for studies on other infections/diseases using DBS-based serology.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Meyers</LastName><ForeName>Eline</ForeName><Initials>E</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-3549-9548</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Coen</LastName><ForeName>Anja</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Padalko</LastName><ForeName>Elizaveta</ForeName><Initials>E</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Laboratory of Medical Microbiology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Cools</LastName><ForeName>Piet</ForeName><Initials>P</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0003-2980-5307</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>17</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>Microbiol Spectr</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101634614</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>2165-0497</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">SARS-CoV-2 antibodies</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">dried blood spots</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">freeze-thaw</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">preservation</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">storage</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>17</Day><Hour>16</Hour><Minute>24</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>17</Day><Hour>16</Hour><Minute>24</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>17</Day><Hour>9</Hour><Minute>3</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39417638</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1128/spectrum.01113-24</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
