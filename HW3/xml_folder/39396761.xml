Adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccination for lactating individuals are not different from the general population, and no evidence has been found that their infants exhibit adverse effects. Yet, there remains substantial hesitation among this population globally regarding the safety of these vaccines.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">Herein we aimed to determine if compositional changes in milk occur following infection or vaccination, including any evidence of vaccine components.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS AND RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Using a subset of milk samples obtained as part of our broad studies examining the effects on milk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination, an extensive multi-omics approach, we found that compared to unvaccinated individuals SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with significant compositional differences in 67 proteins, 385 lipids, and 13 metabolites. In contrast, COVID-19 vaccination was not associated with any changes in lipids or metabolites, although it was associated with changes in 13 or fewer proteins. Compositional changes in milk differed by vaccine. Changes following vaccination were greatest after 1-6 hours for the mRNA-based Moderna vaccine (8 changed proteins), 3 days for the mRNA-based Pfizer (4 changed proteins), and adenovirus-based Johnson and Johnson (13 changed proteins) vaccines. Proteins that changed after both natural infection and Johnson and Johnson vaccine were associated mainly with systemic inflammatory responses. In addition, no vaccine components were detected in any milk sample.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Together, our data provide evidence of only minimal changes in milk composition due to COVID-19 vaccination, with much greater changes after natural SARS-CoV-2 infection.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024 American Society for Nutrition.
