There is some evidence that occupational stress contributes to poor well-being in this occupational group, but little research on the aspects of the job that are perceived to be particularly challenging.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="AIMS" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">This study aimed to explore diplomatic personnel's perceptions of their organization and their roles and to identify aspects of the job, which could cause stress and potentially affect well-being.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 24 employees of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office between September 2021 and February 2022. Participants were asked to reflect on their experiences before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Thematic analysis was used to analyse data.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Participants enjoyed many aspects of their work including the variety, travel opportunities and feeling that they made a difference. They also identified several stressors relating to job demands, overseas postings, family needs, frequent relocation, hardship posts, workplace relationships, (lack of) appreciation and acknowledgement, and organizational culture. Good relationships with colleagues and managers were perceived to be very important.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Findings suggest various ways in which diplomatic organizations can better support their personnel, highlighting workload management; cross-cultural training; providing appropriate support to both accompanying families and unaccompanied staff members; practical and psychological preparation for those in high-risk locations; encouraging positive workplace relationships; good management; increased autonomy and increased recognition for good work.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Â© The Author(s) 2024.
