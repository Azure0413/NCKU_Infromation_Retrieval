Understanding the current landscape of their prevalence and association is needed to capture evolving social, environmental, and economic conditions, and ensure interventions remain relevant to addressing current childhood trauma.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVE" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">This study provides an updated analysis of the association between ACEs and ADHD using post-acute-COVID-19 pandemic data.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">This cross-sectional study of 10,518 children aged 5 to 17 years old derived data from the 2021 to 2022 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Differences in the prevalence of number (0, 1-3, or 4+) and type of ACEs by ADHD diagnosis were evaluated using Rao-Scott chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression. All analyses incorporate complex survey weights.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">In 2021 to 2022, 2,457 (23.3%) of children experienced ACEs and 1,115 (9.9%) had an ADHD diagnosis. Children with ADHD were more likely to experience every type of ACE and were more likely to have 1 to 3 or 4+ ACEs than children without ADHD. Children with 4+ ACEs had higher odds of having an ADHD diagnosis (aOR: 3.44, 95% CI [2.64, 4.49]) than children without ACEs. Male children, children with fair or poor health, and children living in rural counties were more likely to have an ADHD diagnosis, while children of color and uninsured children were less likely. We found the odds ratio of ADHD diagnosis for children with four or more ACEs, compared to those without ACEs, slightly lower than found in Brown et al., 2017's estimate of 3.97 (CI [3.29, 4.80]). These results suggest a consistent association between ACEs and ADHD when comparing pre-COVID data to our post-acute-COVID results.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">These findings highlight the need for clinicians to consider traumatic stress in ADHD screening. Policymakers and early childhood organizations should encourage early screening and intervention for ACEs to reduce the impacts of ADHD diagnoses.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Boswell</LastName><ForeName>Emma</ForeName><Initials>E</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0009-0006-3704-1182</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>University of South Carolina, Columbia, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Crouch</LastName><ForeName>Elizabeth</ForeName><Initials>E</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>University of South Carolina, Columbia, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Odahowski</LastName><ForeName>Cassie</ForeName><Initials>C</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>University of South Carolina, Columbia, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Hung</LastName><ForeName>Peiyin</ForeName><Initials>P</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>University of South Carolina, Columbia, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>18</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>J Atten Disord</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>9615686</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1087-0547</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">adverse childhood experiences</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">attention deficit/hyperactive disorder</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">child development and behavior</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">mental health</Keyword></KeywordList><CoiStatement>Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</CoiStatement></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>18</Day><Hour>16</Hour><Minute>20</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>18</Day><Hour>16</Hour><Minute>20</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>18</Day><Hour>7</Hour><Minute>14</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39422221</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1177/10870547241290673</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
