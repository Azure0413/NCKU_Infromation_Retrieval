Descriptive statistics were used to present the sociodemographic characteristics and scores of outcome measures. Pearson's correlation coefficient and multiple linear regression with backward selection were conducted to examine how nurses' characteristics and workplace factors influence nurses' intent-to-stay.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The mean age of the participants was 29.2 years. The mean scores for the outcomes were intent-to-stay (mean = 2.96), resilience (mean = 3.34), occupational self-efficacy (mean = 4.34), sleep quality (mean = 9.73) and workplace environment scores (mean = 3.15). The correlation analysis showed that resilience, occupational self-efficacy, self-realisation and workload were positively correlated to intent-to-stay while sleep quality was negatively correlated to intent-to-stay. Multiple linear regression analysis found occupational self-efficacy, sleep quality, workload, nervousness, nurses' designation and specialisation status to be significant factors associated with intent-to-stay.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Intent-to-stay is a complex and multidimensional construct influenced by a variety of personal and workplace factors. Hospital administrators should endeavour to develop measures to improve occupational self-efficacy, workload, nervousness and push for specialisation training to bolster nurses' intent-to-stay.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="IMPACT" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Against an everchanging healthcare landscape following the COVID-19 pandemic, the findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the factors of registered nurses' intent-to-stay. The findings of this study alluded to the importance of professional development and workload as factors that can influence registered nurses' intent-to-stay. Hospital administrators can prioritise workforce retention policies by introducing strategies such as opportunities for upskilling, flexible working hours and streamlining work processes to promote nurses' intent-to-stay.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">No patient or public contribution.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© 2024 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Chua</LastName><ForeName>Ming Marcus</ForeName><Initials>MM</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0009-0002-4292-233X</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Nursing, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, National Healthcare Group, Singapore City, Singapore.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Ang</LastName><ForeName>Wei How Darryl</ForeName><Initials>WHD</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-1286-3175</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Alice Lee Centre for Nursing Studies, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore City, Singapore.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Siew</LastName><ForeName>An Ling</ForeName><Initials>AL</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0001-6111-5336</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Nursing Implementation, Translation, and Research Office, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, National Healthcare Group, Singapore City, Singapore.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Chen</LastName><ForeName>Hui-Chen</ForeName><Initials>HC</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-4026-2414</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Alice Lee Centre for Nursing Studies, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore City, Singapore.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><GrantList CompleteYN="Y"><Grant><GrantID>H-569-00-000005</GrantID><Agency>National University of Singapore Research Fellow Start Up Grant</Agency><Country /></Grant></GrantList><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>09</Month><Day>26</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>England</Country><MedlineTA>J Adv Nurs</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>7609811</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>0309-2402</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">intent‐to‐stay</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">nurses</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">occupational self‐efficacy</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">resilience</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">sleep quality</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">workplace environment</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="revised"><Year>2024</Year><Month>8</Month><Day>2</Day></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="received"><Year>2024</Year><Month>5</Month><Day>7</Day></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="accepted"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>1</Day></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>26</Day><Hour>12</Hour><Minute>44</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>26</Day><Hour>12</Hour><Minute>44</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>26</Day><Hour>8</Hour><Minute>43</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39324756</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1111/jan.16459</ArticleId></ArticleIdList><ReferenceList><Title>References</Title><Reference><Citation>Al Maqbali, M. 2021. “Sleep Disturbance Among Frontline Nurses During the COVID‐19 Pandemic.” Sleep and Biological Rhythms 19, no. 4: 467–473.</Citation></Reference><Reference><Citation>Al Yahyaei, A., A.
