Our objectives were 2-fold: first, to assess the prevalence of physical IPV and increased aggression from a husband or partner that occurred during pregnancy and was perceived to be due to the COVID-19 pandemic; second, to examine associations between these experiences and (1) COVID-19-related stressors and (2) postpartum outcomes.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">We used data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System that were collected in 29 US jurisdictions among individuals with a live birth in 2020. We estimated the prevalence of violence during pregnancy by demographic characteristics and COVID-19-related stressors. We calculated adjusted prevalence ratios (APRs) to examine associations of physical IPV or increased aggression with COVID-19-related stressors, postpartum outcomes, and infant birth outcomes.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Among 14 154 respondents, 1.6% reported physical IPV during pregnancy, and 3.1% reported increased aggression by a husband or partner due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents experiencing any economic, housing, or childcare COVID-19-related stressors reported approximately twice the prevalence of both types of violence as compared with those without COVID-19-related stressors. Physical IPV and increased aggression were associated with a higher prevalence of postpartum depressive symptoms (APRs, 1.73 and 2.28, respectively) and postpartum cigarette smoking (APRs, 1.74 and 2.19). Physical IPV was associated with a lower prevalence of attending postpartum care visits (APR, 1.84).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Our findings support the need for ongoing efforts to prevent IPV during pregnancy and to ensure the availability of resources during public health emergencies.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author
