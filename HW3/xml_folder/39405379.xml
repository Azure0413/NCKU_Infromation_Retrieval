Data regarding follow-up and recovery of patients who are placed on ECMO support after COVID-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or ARDS for any other reason are limited. In our study, we share the 1 year follow-up results and cardiopulmonary exercise test results of the discharged patients. Between April 2020 and February 2022, a total of 29 patients who were supported with VV ECMO due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related ARDS, weaned successfully and discharged to home, and who came for regular follow-up after discharge from the hospital and underwent examinations were included in the study. A total of 35 patients weaned successfully. Thirty patients were discharged to home. Mean age of the patients was 37.1 (±10.3) and 16 (55%) patients were male. Mean ECMO support time was 49.1 (±22.3) days. One year of survival after discharge was 100%. None of the patients had mobilization problems at the end of 12 month follow-up. Mean VO2 max was 18.9 at the end of 12 months. Return to work rate was 90%. We think that starting rehabilitation in the early period, and including patients in post-ECMO follow-up programs by ECMO centers will contribute significantly not only to the functional recovery of patients but also to their integration into social life.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © ASAIO 2024.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Ozgur</LastName><ForeName>Mustafa Mert</ForeName><Initials>MM</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0001-8204-9008</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>From the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Koşuyolu High Specialized Education and Research Hospital, Kartal, İstanbul.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Altinay</LastName><ForeName>Ece</ForeName><Initials>E</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Anesthesiology, Koşuyolu High Specialized Education and Research Hospital, Kartal, İstanbul.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Ogus</LastName><ForeName>Halide</ForeName><Initials>H</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Anesthesiology, Koşuyolu High Specialized Education and Research Hospital, Kartal, İstanbul.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Acar</LastName><ForeName>Rezzan Deniz</ForeName><Initials>RD</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0003-1870-4527</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Cardiology, Koşuyolu High Specialized Education and Research Hospital, Kartal, İstanbul.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Atagun Guney</LastName><ForeName>Pinar</ForeName><Initials>P</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Pulmonology, Koşuyolu High Specialized Education and Research Hospital, Kartal, İstanbul.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Kirali</LastName><ForeName>Kaan</ForeName><Initials>K</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0003-0044-4691</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>From the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Koşuyolu High Specialized Education and Research Hospital, Kartal, İstanbul.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>16</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>ASAIO J</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>9204109</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1058-2916</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><CoiStatement>Disclosure: The authors have no conflicts of interest to report.</CoiStatement></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>15</Day><Hour>22</Hour><Minute>18</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>15</Day><Hour>22</Hour><Minute>18</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>15</Day><Hour>14</Hour><Minute>12</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39405379</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1097/MAT.0000000000002337</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="pii">00002480-990000000-00579</ArticleId></ArticleIdList><ReferenceList><Reference><Citation>WHO chief declares end to COVID-19 as a global health emergency.
