This population has higher rates of COVID-19 infection and death compared with non-Latinx White Americans mainly due to long-standing problems related to Social Determinants of Health. Communication about issues such as health threats and safety measures are a vital part of public health, and need to be appropriate to the population of focus. To understand the effectiveness of public health communication to Latinx communities in Michigan during the COVID-19 pandemic, semi-structured interviews (<i>n</i> = 16) and three focus groups (<i>n</i> = 24 participants) were conducted virtually in 2021 across counties in Michigan deeply impacted by COVID-19: Washtenaw, Kent, Genesee, and Wayne. Participants shared some facilitating factors that supported effective health communication during the pandemic for their communities. For instance, in their experiences, religious and community leaders were especially effective in communicating information about the pandemic. They also expressed issues with English often being the only language of official communication; the need for bilingual options; and, the need for multiple channels of communication to reach as many people as possible. Participants also highlighted their concerns about inconsistent government communication and politicizing messages as a hindering factor that impacted effective health communication within their communities. Lessons from successes and failures experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic are vital to improving health outcomes for marginalized communities during public health crises. Future responses must ensure that public health communication is appropriate and effective for Latinx communities to better protect them.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Cross</LastName><ForeName>Fernanda L</ForeName><Initials>FL</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-0770-9464</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Hunt</LastName><ForeName>Rebecca</ForeName><Initials>R</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0003-2643-4205</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Buyuktur</LastName><ForeName>Ayse G</ForeName><Initials>AG</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Woolford</LastName><ForeName>Susan J</ForeName><Initials>SJ</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Reyes</LastName><ForeName>Angela</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Detroit Hispanic Development Corporation, Detroit, MI, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Led√≥n</LastName><ForeName>Charo</ForeName><Initials>C</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Buenos Vecinos, Ann Arbor, MI USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Israel</LastName><ForeName>Barbara</ForeName><Initials>B</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Marsh</LastName><ForeName>Erica E</ForeName><Initials>EE</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Platt</LastName><ForeName>Jodyn</ForeName><Initials>J</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>09</Month><Day>23</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>Health Educ Behav</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>9704962</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1090-1981</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Health communications</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Latino/Latina/Latinx or Hispanic</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">community based participatory research</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">population groups</Keyword></KeywordList><CoiStatement>Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</CoiStatement></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>23</Day><Hour>12</Hour><Minute>46</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>23</Day><Hour>12</Hour><Minute>46</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>23</Day><Hour>8</Hour><Minute>33</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39311495</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1177/10901981241278962</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
