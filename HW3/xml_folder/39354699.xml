We investigated the pattern of the reduction in suicide by sex, age, method, and outbreak period in the two countries.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Suicide data for Taiwan (2015-2021) and South Korea (2017-2021) stratified by sex, age, method, and month were extracted from national mortality data files in the two countries. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate suicide rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals across outbreak and inter-outbreak periods during the pandemic, relative to that expected based on pre-pandemic trends, and their associations with economic and outbreak control stringency indicators.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">There were fewer-than-expected suicides in Taiwan (7%-16% fewer suicides over outbreaks and inter-outbreaks) and South Korea (17% fewer suicides in outbreaks III and IV). Fewer-than-expected suicides were found primarily in the working-age populations aged 25 to 64 years in Taiwan and those aged 45 to 64 years in South Korea. In both countries, fewer-than-expected suicides by charcoal burning during the pandemic were consistently found; the greatest reduction occurred when the outbreak control measures were most restricted. Increased time at residence was associated with decreased suicide rates in South Korea.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Taiwan and South Korea showed reduced suicide rates during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2021. Potential reasons for the decrease in suicides may include reduced access to suicide means during outbreaks in the two countries.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© 2024 The Author(s).
