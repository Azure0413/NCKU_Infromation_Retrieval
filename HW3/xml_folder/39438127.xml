As a secondary aim, we explored communication needs and strategies for these recommended vaccines.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="DESIGN" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">We applied a concurrent, multi-method study design (survey and interview) with 23 Hispanic/Latinx American parents of adolescents aged 11-18 years. An inductive deductive thematic approach was used to interpret interview data. Descriptives were used to analyze survey data.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Overall, most parents (77%) perceived that their child was receiving too many vaccines. Regarding hesitancy for the HPV vaccine, major parental concerns related to vaccine effectiveness (83%), vaccine necessity (83%), and vaccine safety (80%). For the COVID vaccine, major concerns were the newness of vaccine (83%), vaccine safety (77%), low perceived effectiveness (77%), and low perceived need (77%). For influenza vaccines, major parental concerns were vaccine safety (73%), low perceived need (73%), and preference for natural over vaccine-induced immunity (73%). Parents had overall positive views towards vaccination. Some parents prioritized school-required vaccines, and others ranked the recommended vaccines- HPV, COVID-19, and influenza vaccines- for their children. They saw the benefits of recommended vaccines; however, there were concerns. The majority received a provider's recommendation for HPV vaccination for their child, while over half had not received a recommendation for COVID-19 and influenza vaccines. Recommended communication strategies were diverse with parents highlighting the need for providers to capitalize on waiting and clinic rooms to provide education.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Healthcare providers should take advantage of missed opportunities, improve healthcare interactions with a strong recommendation and persistent communication, and offer diverse communication strategies and messaging for vaccines. Future work should further explore multi-vaccine concerns and how addressing these concerns through healthcare-provider communication could improve HPV vaccination along with COVID-19 and influenza vaccination.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Grimaldi</LastName><ForeName>Carolina Gomez</ForeName><Initials>CG</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-1719-1021</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Stewart</LastName><ForeName>Elizabeth C</ForeName><Initials>EC</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0003-2073-6069</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Graduate School of Public Health Practice, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, TN, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Edwards</LastName><ForeName>Kathryn</ForeName><Initials>K</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0003-3912-9832</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Barajas</LastName><ForeName>Claudia</ForeName><Initials>C</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Cunningham-Erves</LastName><ForeName>Jennifer</ForeName><Initials>J</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-7780-9874</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Graduate School of Public Health Practice, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, TN, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Health Policy, School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>22</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>England</Country><MedlineTA>Ethn Health</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>9608374</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1355-7858</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">COVID-19</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Hispanic/Latino</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">SDG 10: Reduced inequalities</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">SDG 3: Good health and well-being</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">SDG 4: Quality education</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Vaccine hesitancy</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">health equity</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">human papillomavirus (HPV)</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">provider communication</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">vaccination</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>23</Day><Hour>4</Hour><Minute>22</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>23</Day><Hour>4</Hour><Minute>22</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>22</Day><Hour>21</Hour><Minute>22</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39438127</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1080/13557858.2024.2417382</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
