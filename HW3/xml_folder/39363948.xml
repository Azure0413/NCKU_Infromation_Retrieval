We conducted 22 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with U.S. mothers with low income who had kindergarten-age children (50% male and 50% female). All participants were female, ranging in age from 24 to 44 years, and reported the following ethnic/racial identities: non-Hispanic Black or African American (41%), Hispanic of any race (36%) and non-Hispanic, White (23%). With a team comprising multiple researchers from varied disciplines (e.g., medicine, education and public health) our analytic process used an iterative approach for developing and revising codes and themes until we reached thematic saturation. Most mothers described negative impacts on social, behavioural and emotional aspects of mental health. Some described positive social impacts, including strengthened family relationships. Mothers described no positive changes to behavioural or emotional aspects of mental health. Maternal perspectives suggest the importance of prioritising access to screening and treating mental health needs to support children's kindergarten transition, mitigate pandemic impacts and plan for future disruptions.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Turnbull</LastName><ForeName>Khara L P</ForeName><Initials>KLP</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0003-0828-4696</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Center for Advanced Study of Teaching and Learning, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Jaworski</LastName><ForeName>Brianna</ForeName><Initials>B</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Center for Advanced Study of Teaching and Learning, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Mateus</LastName><ForeName>Deiby Mayaris Cubides</ForeName><Initials>DMC</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Center for Advanced Study of Teaching and Learning, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Coolman</LastName><ForeName>Frances L</ForeName><Initials>FL</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Center for Advanced Study of Teaching and Learning, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>College of Education, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>LoCasale-Crouch</LastName><ForeName>Jennifer</ForeName><Initials>J</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Center for Advanced Study of Teaching and Learning, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>School of Education, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Moon</LastName><ForeName>Rachel Y</ForeName><Initials>RY</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Pediatrics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Hauck</LastName><ForeName>Fern R</ForeName><Initials>FR</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Family Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Kellams</LastName><ForeName>Ann</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Pediatrics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Colson</LastName><ForeName>Eve R</ForeName><Initials>ER</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Pediatrics, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><GrantList CompleteYN="Y"><Grant><GrantID>R01 HD091130</GrantID><Acronym>HD</Acronym><Agency>NICHD NIH HHS</Agency><Country>United States</Country></Grant></GrantList><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>03</Month><Day>03</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>England</Country><MedlineTA>Infant Child Dev</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>100887625</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1522-7219</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">COVID-19 pandemic</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">kindergarten transition</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">low income</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">mental health</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">qualitative</Keyword></KeywordList><CoiStatement>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.</CoiStatement></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>4</Day><Hour>8</Hour><Minute>44</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>4</Day><Hour>8</Hour><Minute>43</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>4</Day><Hour>4</Hour><Minute>16</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pmc-release"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>3</Day></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>ppublish</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39363948</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="mid">NIHMS1981493</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="pmc">PMC11448681</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1002/icd.2503</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="pii">e2503</ArticleId></ArticleIdList><ReferenceList><Reference><Citation>Benzies K, &amp; Mychasiuk R (2009).
