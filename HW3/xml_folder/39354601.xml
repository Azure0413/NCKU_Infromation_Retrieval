We hypothesized that rates of DE would be greater after the onset of COVID-19 as compared to before. We also hypothesized that those identifying as women, reporting higher alcohol or drug use, and contemplating suicide would have greater odds of reporting symptoms consistent with DE.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">DE was significantly lower in pre-pandemic years compared to pandemic years: ESP pre = 38.01%(n = 704), pandemic = 48.79%(n = 645), p &lt; 0.001; SCOFF pre = 22.82%(n = 422), pandemic = 31.46%(n = 414), p &lt; 0.001. Logistic regressions showed women and students who contemplated suicide reported significantly greater DE, regardless of screener or time period. Inconsistent relationships were found between DE and current substance use.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">These findings may inform targeted interventions for those most vulnerable to disordered eating.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© 2024.

Many emerging adults attend college, and during this time DE may occur. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to situations, like being isolated from friends and family, that we assume could increase DE. To present data on the rates of DE before and after the start of COVID-19, researchers collected data on whether college students engaged in DE two years before the start of COVID-19 (2019, 2020) and two after COVID-19 (2021, 2022). They considered whether characteristics of the student, like whether they were a man or woman or their race, were related to DE. DE increased significantly after COVID-19. Using one questionnaire, DE was about 38% before COVID-19 and increased to nearly 50% after COVID-19. Across all four years, women and students who thought about suicide were more likely to report DE. It is important to direct resources to students who are experiencing DE – which we now know could be as many as 50%. DE contributes to health problems and can worsen over time, leading to a life-threatening eating disorder.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© 2024.
