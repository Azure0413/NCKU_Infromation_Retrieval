Non-drug measures of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), such as acupuncture, cupping and moxibustion, are commonly used as adjuncts in China to help in severe cases, but their effects remain unclear.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVES" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">To observe the clinical effect of TCM non-drug measures in improving respiratory function and symptoms among patients with severe COVID-19.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS" NlmCategory="METHODS">This study was designed as a multicenter, assessor-blind, randomized controlled trial. Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were randomly assigned to the treatment or control group. The treatment group received individualized TCM non-drug measures in combination with prone position ventilation, while the control group received prone position ventilation only for 5 consecutive days.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES" NlmCategory="METHODS">The primary outcome measures were the percentage of patients with improved oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) at the end of the 5-day intervention, as well as changes of patients' respiratory rates. The secondary outcome measures included changes in SpO<sub>2</sub> and total score on the self-made respiratory symptom scale. The improvement rate, defined as a 3-day consecutive increase in SpO<sub>2</sub>, the duration of prone positioning, and adverse events were recorded as well.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Among the 198 patients included in the intention-to-treat analysis, 159 (80.3%) completed all assessments on day 5, and 39 (19.7%) patients withdrew from the study. At the end of the intervention, 71 (91%) patients in the treatment group had SpO<sub>2</sub> above 93%, while 61 (75.3%) in the control group reached this level. The proportion of participant with improved SpO<sub>2</sub> was significantly greater in the intervention group (mean difference [MD] = 15.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.4, 27.1; P = 0.008). Compared to the baseline, with daily treatment there were significant daily decreases in respiratory rates in both groups, but no statistical differences between groups were found (all P ≥ 0.05). Compared to the control group, the respiratory-related symptoms score was lower among patients in the treatment group (MD = -1.7; 95%CI: -2.8, -0.5; P = 0.008) after day 3 of treatment. A gradual decrease in the total scores of both groups was also observed. Thirty-one adverse events occurred during the intervention, and 2 patients were transferred to the intensive care unit due to deterioration of their illness.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">TCM non-drug measures combined with prone positioning can effectively treat patients with severe COVID-19. The combined therapy significantly increased SpO<sub>2</sub> and improved symptom scores compared to prone positioning alone, thus improving the patients' respiratory function to help them recover. However, the improvement rate did not differ between the two groups.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="TRIAL REGISTRATION" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2300068319).
