Three regression tree models were built using an R package, Recursive Partitioning for Modeling Survey (rpms), to examine propensities over time of receiving a (1) first dose of a two-dose COVID-19 mRNA primary vaccination series or single dose of the Janssen vaccine (vaccine initiation), (2) primary series completion, and (3) monovalent booster dose, using a conditional linear effect model. Persons ≥50 years were more likely to complete a primary series and receive a first booster dose; persons reporting having received non-COVID-19 vaccines recently were more likely to initiate vaccination, complete the primary series, and get a first booster dose; persons reporting having work or school requirements were more likely to complete the primary series. Persons not reporting having received non-COVID-19 vaccines in 2 years but reporting having work or school vaccination requirements were more likely to initiate vaccination than those without work/school requirements. Among persons not reporting having received non-COVID-19 vaccines in 2 years and not reporting having work or school vaccination requirements, those aged ≥50 years were more likely to initiate vaccination than were younger adults. Propensity of receiving various doses was correlated with age, having recently received non-COVID 19 vaccines, and having vaccination requirements at work or school. Regression tree methodology enabled modeling of different COVID-19 vaccination dose propensities as a linear effect of time, revealed changes in relationships over time between demographic factors and propensity of receipt of different doses, and identified populations that may benefit from vaccination outreach efforts.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Published by Elsevier Ltd.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Earp</LastName><ForeName>Morgan</ForeName><Initials>M</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, United States.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Meng</LastName><ForeName>Lu</ForeName><Initials>L</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, United States.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Black</LastName><ForeName>Carla L</ForeName><Initials>CL</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, United States.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Carter</LastName><ForeName>Rosalind J</ForeName><Initials>RJ</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, United States.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Lu</LastName><ForeName>Peng-Jun</ForeName><Initials>PJ</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, United States.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Singleton</LastName><ForeName>James A</ForeName><Initials>JA</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, United States.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Chorba</LastName><ForeName>Terence</ForeName><Initials>T</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, United States.
