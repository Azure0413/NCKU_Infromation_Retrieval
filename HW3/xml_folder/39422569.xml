We quantified receipt of dexamethasone, remdesivir, and combined use of dexamethasone and remdesivir during the hospital stay. We used 2-level logistic regression models to determine the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) at the hospital level, adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics. The ICC shows the proportion of total variation in drug use accounted for by hospitals.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Among 161,667 individuals hospitalized with COVID-19, 73.0% were treated with dexamethasone, 49.1% with remdesivir, and 45.0% with both dexamethasone and remdesivir. The proportion of variation in dexamethasone use was 12.7% (adjusted ICC: 0.127), 8.5% for remdesivir, and 11.3% for combined drug use, indicating low interhospital variation. In the fully adjusted models, between-facility variation in dexamethasone use declined from 34.1% in February-March 2020 to 11.3% in January-March 2021 and then increased to 17.3% in July-October 2021. The variation in remdesivir use remained relatively stable during the study period.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">During the first 2 years of the pandemic, there was relatively consistent use of dexamethasone and remdesivir across the hospitals examined. Consistent adoption and implementation of treatment guidelines across the hospitals examined may have led to a decrease in variation in drug usage over time.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.
