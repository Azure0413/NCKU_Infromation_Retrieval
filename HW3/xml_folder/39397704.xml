However, insufficient attention has been paid to how such activities can be implemented in practice across different contexts, particularly in socio-economically disadvantaged areas. Therefore, we explored the implementation of a dance-based intervention in two primary schools situated in an area of high economic deprivation in North East England.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Our study explored Year 1 (age 5-6) and Year 5 (age 9-10) children, their parents, teachers and dance artists' views of a creative dance intervention (South Tees Arts project; STAR) in two schools in North East England, using interviews and focus groups, combined with innovative data capture activities (i.e. movement activities, graffiti walls, songs and Vox Pops).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Children felt that STAR contributed positively to their emotional wellbeing and physical health. Teachers noticed improved confidence, engagement, literacy, and social and motor skills and less disruptive behaviour in class. Benefits continued beyond school, with children exercising at home to practice their dance moves. Several implementation barriers were identified ranging from limited time, large classes, dealing with challenging behaviours, the impact of COVID-19, stigma and anxiety. In response to these challenges, several solutions were developed during project delivery, such as artists and children working in pairs and role modelling by teachers and dance artists.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">We found three underlying mechanisms for successful implementation: (1) constant communication between teachers, dance artists and parents was essential to managing challenging behaviours, building personal relationships with children, and helping parents to get involved and support their children at home. (2) Linking dance activities to the school curriculum (using narratives from existing reading schemes) helped to support skill gaps. (3) A strong ethos of partnership between school, dance and arts providers and researchers ensured the adaptability and flexibility of projects.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>van der Graaf</LastName><ForeName>P</ForeName><Initials>P</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-2466-2792</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Northumbria University, B117, Coach Lane Campus (West), Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 8ST, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Azevedo</LastName><ForeName>L</ForeName><Initials>L</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>El Zerbi</LastName><ForeName>C</ForeName><Initials>C</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Landindome</LastName><ForeName>P N</ForeName><Initials>PN</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Teesside University, Middlesbrough, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Watson</LastName><ForeName>P</ForeName><Initials>P</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Teesside University, Middlesbrough, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>14</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>Perspect Public Health</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101499631</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1757-9147</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">children</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">dance interventions</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">evaluation</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">implementation</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">mental health and wellbeing</Keyword></KeywordList><CoiStatement>Conflict of InterestThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.</CoiStatement></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>14</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>21</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>14</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>21</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>14</Day><Hour>5</Hour><Minute>23</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39397704</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1177/17579139241282549</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
