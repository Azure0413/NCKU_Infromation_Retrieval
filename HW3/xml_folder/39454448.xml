Music and Movement for Health (MMH) is one such systematically developed interdisciplinary arts-based intervention designed to enhance health and wellbeing of older adults. The objective of this qualitative study was to explore the opinions and experiences of participants, facilitators, and community stakeholders of the MMH intervention.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="MATERIALS AND METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">This embedded qualitative study was completed as part of a wider evaluation of the MMH intervention. A purposive sample of older adults who had completed MMH (n = 71), facilitators (n = 8) and community stakeholders (n = 4) participated in this study. Data were collected through a combination of focus groups and telephone/virtual interviews. Data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Data analysis led to the generation of the overarching theme 'Positive ageing in place', which encompassed two themes: (1) 'Intersection of exercise and arts' and (2) 'Fostering a sense of belonging', and five subthemes. MMH was viewed as a unique arts-based intervention that combined participants' interest in music and dance and had many perceived physical and psychological benefits. Additionally, MMH provided routine and social opportunities to older adults, which were particularly valued in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The provision of exercise through the arts was enjoyable and, resultantly, desirable to many older adults, with perceived positive physical and psychosocial outcomes. Consequently, the use of arts-based interventions for health promotion and social opportunities among older adults warrants further investigation.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="TRIAL REGISTRATION" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">ISRCTN35313497.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024.
