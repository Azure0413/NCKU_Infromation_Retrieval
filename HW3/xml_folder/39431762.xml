Home visits were conducted by home health nurses every 2 weeks, supplemented by weekly home visits and phone counseling provided by volunteers, for a duration of 20 weeks. This mixed methods study used quantitative and qualitative approaches. Quantitative data were gathered through a questionnaire survey to assess the intervention's effects on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), loneliness, and depression. The qualitative component focused on participants' evaluation of the program.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Significant changes were noted in HRQOL scores with an effect size of 0.6 (<i>p</i> = 0.01). Results indicated the positive impact of the TFL program on HRQOL among older adults as their health status was continuously monitored by volunteers who provided care and home health nurses who assisted with health management during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">In a pandemic, personalized health management, such as regular health check-ins provided by home health nurses and home or phone visits provided by volunteers, is crucial for isolated older adults. This pilot program enhanced participants' HRQOL through continuous health monitoring, volunteer care, and nurse support, even during the COVID-19 pandemic.
