The substantial volume of these operations underscores their considerable impact on healthcare systems and resource allocation. Recent guidelines in the United Kingdom have emphasized the safety and feasibility of performing tonsillectomies as day-case surgeries. The interplay of medical necessity, high incidence, and evolving guidelines underscores the importance of continually evaluating and optimizing tonsillectomy practices. This study assesses the outcomes of paediatric tonsillectomies at a UK tertiary centre during the COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of day-case guidelines. Methodology A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients under 18 years of age who underwent tonsillectomy between April 2021 and September 2022. Data on postoperative events until discharge and re-attendance within 14 days were recorded. High-risk subgroups were analysed: subgroup A (two years of age and weighing 12-15 kg), and subgroup B (severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) on polysomnography defined as an apnoea/hypopnoea index &gt;30 events per hour). Binary logistic regression assessed whether age, weight, sex, or procedure time predicted extended hospital stay (more than one night) or the need for oxygen. Day-case tonsillectomy guidelines were created after multi-disciplinary team approval. Results A total of 117 patients underwent tonsillectomy, with a median age of four (n = 72 male). OSA/sleep-disordered breathing accounted for 88% (n = 103), and 68% (n = 70) underwent a preoperative sleep study. Same-day discharge rate was 26% (n = 31). Postoperatively, 86 patients were admitted; 44 required overnight oxygen saturation monitoring, 35 for weight extremes, and seven for poor oral intake. Of those admitted, 70 (81%) patients remained well overnight, and 76 (88%) patients were discharged the next day. In subgroup A (n = 17), the average weight was 13.4 kg; two had transient desaturations. Fourteen were discharged the next day. In subgroup B (n = 34), four had transient desaturations with a further two requiring oxygen. Weight (p = 0.071) within the 'extended hospital stay model' and procedure time (p = 0.052) within the 'need for oxygen' model approached significance for predicting outcomes. Conclusions This study offers early insights into paediatric tonsillectomy outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic at a tertiary centre. Although the same-day discharge rate was lower than the national average, most patients, including high-risk groups, remained clinically stable and were discharged within 24 hours.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024, Nuredini et al.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Nuredini</LastName><ForeName>Gani N</ForeName><Initials>GN</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Imperial College London, London, GBR.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Coyle</LastName><ForeName>Paula</ForeName><Initials>P</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Imperial College London, London, GBR.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>09</Month><Day>05</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>Cureus</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101596737</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>2168-8184</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">clinical practice guideline</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">covid-19</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">day-case surgery</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">obstructive sleep apnoea</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">tonsillectomy</Keyword></KeywordList><CoiStatement>Human subjects: Consent was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
