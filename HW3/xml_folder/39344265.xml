Seriously ill patients surpass the supply of PC cliniciansin their work clinicians face repeated loss and extreme suffering which can have deleterious consequences, such as burnout and attrition. We urgently need interventions that foster thriving communities in this emotionally complex environment. Storytelling represents a promising path forward. In response to widespread loneliness and moral distress among PC clinicians before, during, and after the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, we created the Palliative Story Exchange (PSE), a storytelling intervention to build community, decrease isolation, and help clinicians rediscover the shared meaning in their work. This paper discusses this novel intervention and initial program evaluation data demonstrating the PSE's impact thus far.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Participants voluntarily complete a post-then-pre wellness survey reflecting on their experience.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Thus far, over 1,000 participants have attended a PSE. In the fall of 2022, we began distributing a post-then-pre-evaluation survey. To date, 130 interprofessional participants from practice locations across 10 different countries completed the survey. Responses demonstrate an increase in the connection that participants felt toward their work and the larger palliative care community after attending a PSE. Further, more than half of all free-text responses include terms such as, "meaningful," "healing," "powerful," and "universal," to describe their participation.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Training programs and healthcare organizations use the humanities to support clinician wellness and improve patient care. The PSE builds upon this work through a novel combination of storytelling, community co-creation using reflection, and shared meaning making. Initial survey data demonstrates that after attending a PSE, participants feel increased meaning in their work, in the significance of their own stories, and connection with the PC community. Moving forward, we seek to expand our community of practice, host a facilitator leadership course, and rigorously study the PSE's impact on clinician wellness outcomes.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Drutchas</LastName><ForeName>Alexis</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0003-1596-1288</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Division of Palliative Care and Geriatric Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Rusch</LastName><ForeName>Rachel</ForeName><Initials>R</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Division of Comfort and Palliative Care, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Boston, MA, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Leiter</LastName><ForeName>Richard</ForeName><Initials>R</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychosocial Oncology and Palliative Care, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>09</Month><Day>30</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>England</Country><MedlineTA>Palliat Support Care</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101232529</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1478-9515</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Palliative care faces a workforce crisis</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">burnout</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">humanities</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">narrative medicine</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">sustainability</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>30</Day><Hour>10</Hour><Minute>18</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>30</Day><Hour>10</Hour><Minute>18</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>30</Day><Hour>2</Hour><Minute>54</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39344265</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1017/S1478951524001226</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="pii">S1478951524001226</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
