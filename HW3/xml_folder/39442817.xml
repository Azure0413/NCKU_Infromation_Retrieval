COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has resulted in over 4.8 million deaths worldwide. Both diseases activate the innate immune response via the same pathway. Studies have suggested that Toxoplasma infection may either protect against or worsen the severity of COVID-19. This meta-analysis investigated the relationship between toxoplasmosis prevalence and COVID-19. The selection of studies was based on a systematic search using specific keywords in Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases between 2019 and 2023. The study findings were analyzed using STATA software version 17.0, and the prevalence of toxoplasmosis in people with COVID-19 and its confidence interval were extracted from the selected studies. The study's heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 test, and publication bias was evaluated using a funnel plot and Egger's test. A p value of 0.05 was considered significant. The meta-analysis included nine studies with a total of 1,972 COVID-19-positive individuals, and the results showed a significant association between T. gondii infection and COVID-19 severity. The I2 statistic was almost 99%, indicating large heterogeneity among the studies. The Egger's test showed no publication bias. The pooled prevalence of T. gondii infection in COVID-19-positive individuals was 0.680 (95% CI: 0.613-0.748), which was significantly higher than the prevalence observed in the general population. The forest plot shows that the prevalence rate was significantly different from that of 0% (P &lt; 0.001). The meta-analysis found that the prevalence of T. gondii infection was significantly higher in individuals with COVID-19 than in the general population, indicating a possible association between the two infections. However, the significant heterogeneity among the studies underscores the need for further research to understand the underlying mechanisms and clinical implications of this association.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Â© 2024.
