We aimed to examine indicators of quality and clinical outcomes (eg, readmissions, death) and sociodemographics in patients with COPD in need of hospital care during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to before the pandemic.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">This was a nationwide register-based study of subjects with a hospital contact due to COPD from January 1, 2015-December 15, 2021, in Denmark. A generalized linear model using Poisson distribution was used to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs) for variables of interest.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">During the pandemic, the early average of admissions was 36% lower than before the pandemic; the average number of out-patients was 23% lower. The proportion of readmissions for exacerbation within 30 d of discharge decreased during the pandemic (PR 0.93 [95% CI 0.90-0.96]). The proportion of subjects who died within 30 d of admission remained unchanged (PR 0.98 [0.94-1.03]). Among out-patients, the proportion with 2 or more exacerbations in the preceding year was lower during the pandemic (PR 0.82 [0.80-0.84]). During the pandemic, both in-patients and out-patients were less likely to be younger, to live alone, and to have a lower educational level.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">In this nationwide study of subjects with COPD, hospital contacts decreased during the pandemic due to lockdowns and isolation, which led to a decrease in infections overall in the society. Meanwhile, in-hospital care remained unaltered. However, concerns are raised about patients with COPD and low educational level and immigrants not seeking relevant health care.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024 by Daedalus Enterprises.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Jensen</LastName><ForeName>Henry</ForeName><Initials>H</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>The Danish Clinical Quality Program - National Clinical Registries (RKKP), Denmark. herjen@rm.dk.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Olesen</LastName><ForeName>Tina Bech</ForeName><Initials>TB</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>The Danish Clinical Quality Program - National Clinical Registries (RKKP), Denmark.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Falstie-Jensen</LastName><ForeName>Anne Mette</ForeName><Initials>AM</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>The Danish Clinical Quality Program - National Clinical Registries (RKKP), Denmark.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Møller</LastName><ForeName>Henrik</ForeName><Initials>H</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>The Danish Clinical Quality Program - National Clinical Registries (RKKP), Denmark.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Jensen</LastName><ForeName>Jens Winther</ForeName><Initials>JW</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>The Danish Clinical Quality Program - National Clinical Registries (RKKP), Denmark.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Løkke</LastName><ForeName>Anders</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Medicine, Little Belt Hospital, Vejle, Denmark; and Department of Regional Health Research, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>09</Month><Day>24</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>Respir Care</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>7510357</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>0020-1324</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">COPD</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">COVID-19</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Denmark</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">quality of care</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>25</Day><Hour>4</Hour><Minute>19</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>25</Day><Hour>4</Hour><Minute>19</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>24</Day><Hour>20</Hour><Minute>43</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39317399</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.4187/respcare.11341</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="pii">respcare.11341</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
