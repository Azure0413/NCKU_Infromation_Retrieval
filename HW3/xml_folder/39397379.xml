This multimodal approach allowed for a rich capture of the children's articulations of their pandemic experiences.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Children's multimodal articulations conveyed not only the biological features of, but also their emotional reactions to the coronavirus. The pandemic had disrupted children's lives, making online learning, sleep and screen engagement dominant in their daily routines, while also compounding children's unhappiness primarily due to restrictions on social interactions. Children associated the coronavirus with biological, medical, psychological and social aspects. Increased sanitisation and hygiene habits featured their pre-to-post pandemic changes. Furthermore, children exhibited an awareness regarding preventive measures and transmission modes, albeit with certain biases or gaps. Their misunderstandings about recuperative strategies merit clarification.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The COVID-19 pandemic has had profound and multifaceted impacts on children's emotional well-being, daily routines, social interactions, education, and health-related behaviors. Children's multimodal articulations revealed a spectrum of adverse effects caused by the pandemic, calling for targeted health interventions to mitigate these negative effects while also equipping children with resilience and coping skills for navigating future health crises. Incorporating children's perspectives and experiences into future pandemic preparedness and health promotion strategies is essential for addressing their vulnerabilities and ensuring their overall well-being during public health crises.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Yang</LastName><ForeName>Daihu</ForeName><Initials>D</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Biological Sciences, Hefei Normal University, Hefei, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Zhou</LastName><ForeName>Minghui</ForeName><Initials>M</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Biological Sciences, Hefei Normal University, Hefei, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Zhang</LastName><ForeName>Yan</ForeName><Initials>Y</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Biological Sciences, Hefei Normal University, Hefei, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Geng</LastName><ForeName>Ming</ForeName><Initials>M</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Biological Sciences, Hefei Normal University, Hefei, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Cheng</LastName><ForeName>Xiaozhong</ForeName><Initials>X</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Biological Sciences, Hefei Normal University, Hefei, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>13</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>England</Country><MedlineTA>Psychol Health</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>8807983</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>0887-0446</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">COVID-19 pandemic</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">articulation</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">children</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">health</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">multimodal representation</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>14</Day><Hour>10</Hour><Minute>17</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>14</Day><Hour>10</Hour><Minute>17</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>14</Day><Hour>2</Hour><Minute>12</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39397379</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1080/08870446.2024.2414797</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
