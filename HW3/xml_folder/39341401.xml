We report data for second boosters among individuals 50-&lt;70 years old primed with AZD1222 (50-&lt;70y-AZD1222) until Day 84.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Immunocompetent adults who received any first booster ≥three months prior were eligible. Participants were randomly allocated to BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 or NVX-CoV2373 1:1:1. The concentrations of ancestral anti-spike immunoglobulin were summarised as the geometric mean concentrations (GMC). Reactogenicity and safety outcomes were captured. Additional analyses including neutralising antibodies were performed on a subset. ACTRN12622000238774.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Between Mar 2022 and Aug 2023, 743 participants were recruited and had D28 samples; 155 belonged to the 50-&lt;70y-AZD1222 stratum. The mean adjusted GMCs (95% credible intervals) were 20,690 (17 555-23 883), 23,867 (20 144-27 604) and 8654 (7267-9962) U/mL at D28 following boosting with BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 and NVX-CoV2372, respectively, and 10,976 (8826-13 196), 15,779 (12 512-19 070) and 6559 (5220-7937) U/mL by D84. IgG against Omicron BA.5 was 2.7-2.9 times lower than the ancestral strain. Limited neutralisation against Omicron subvariants was found following all vaccines. Severe reactogenicity events were &lt;4%.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">All vaccines were immunogenic with more rapid waning after mRNA vaccines. These data support boosting with vaccines with greater specificity for circulating Omicron subvariants.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..
