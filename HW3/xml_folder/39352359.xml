However, few studies examine this population, and even less disaggregate findings by HIV status.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">We analyzed data from 834 South African adolescent mothers, 35% living with HIV (LHIV), who reported on physical, psychological, and sexual IPV exposure at two interviews: 2018-2019 (prepandemic) and 2021-2022 (during COVID-19). We estimated lifetime prevalence of IPV, disaggregating by HIV status. We used inverse weighted probability multivariate mixed-effects logistic regression to examine changes in IPV between the two periods and if changes in IPV differed by HIV status.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">A quarter of adolescent mothers had experienced any IPV during COVID-19, quadruple prepandemic levels (24.7% vs. 6.0%). The increase was driven by surges in physical (+15.7%) and psychological (+11.2%) IPV. In both periods, psychosocial and physical IPV were the most prevalent forms and the most common combination among those who had experienced multiple forms of IPV. Exposure to any IPV was significantly more prevalent among those LHIV compared to those without HIV, prepandemic (9.5% vs. 4.1%, p = .026) and during COVID-19 (31.8% vs. 20.6%, p &lt; .001). Adjusted models revealed an 18.2% significant increase in the average predicted probability of reporting IPV during COVID-19 compared to prepandemic, with no differential effect by HIV status.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="DISCUSSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Adolescent mothers experienced a significantly higher burden of IPV during COVID-19 than prepandemic, with those LHIV experiencing the highest level. Initiatives to reduce IPV need to reach adolescent mothers, particularly those living with HIV.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.
