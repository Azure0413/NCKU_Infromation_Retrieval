Achieving transdisciplinary teams at the large organisation or system level has not been extensively studied.PurposeTo examine and describe exemplar organisations where transdisciplinary working was enabled and that can be reproduced in other organisations.MethodsAn expert panel reached consensus on three healthcare organisations in the USA that exemplified transdisciplinary working. Available public information about each organisation was reviewed and site visits with direct observation and interviews were conducted with two of the three exemplar sites (the third completed remotely due to the onset of COVID-19). The process of immersion-crystallisation was used to review the collated material and to identify key themes that were then repeatedly checked with the expert panel.ResultsConsistent themes were identified across all three organisations, although they each arrived at these commonalities via distinctly different routes. All had a clear and shared creation story as to how they came about as an entity, which was supported by consistent longitudinal leadership. This enabled an environment whereby each organisation created its own language that reflected their culture as an organisation, thus continually reinforcing the uniqueness of their organisation.ConclusionsLarge healthcare organisations can achieve the concepts of transdisciplinary practice. While no single achievement pathway was identified, common themes noted were a clear creation story, consistent leadership, and building a language that reflected the organisation.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Chadwick</LastName><ForeName>Martin</ForeName><Initials>M</Initials></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Hemler</LastName><ForeName>Jennifer R</ForeName><Initials>JR</Initials></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Crabtree</LastName><ForeName>Benjamin F</ForeName><Initials>BF</Initials></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>14</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>Australia</Country><MedlineTA>Aust Health Rev</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>8214381</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>0156-5788</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="received"><Year>2024</Year><Month>4</Month><Day>4</Day></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="accepted"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>20</Day></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>14</Day><Hour>4</Hour><Minute>18</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>14</Day><Hour>4</Hour><Minute>18</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>13</Day><Hour>19</Hour><Minute>23</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39396812</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1071/AH24089</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="pii">AH24089</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle>
