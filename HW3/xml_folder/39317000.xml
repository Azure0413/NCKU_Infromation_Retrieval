Data from 476 participants in the Clinical Health Outcomes Initiative in Comparative Effectiveness for Bipolar Disorder study were used to fit several regularised Gaussian Graphical Models. Differences in the presentation of depressive and manic symptoms were uncovered: only among participants with a history of childhood abuse, inadequacy and pessimism were central symptoms in the network of depressive symptoms, while racing thoughts was an important symptom in the network of manic symptoms. Following network theory, focusing treatments at the symptom-level and on central symptoms - like inadequacy, pessimism, and racing thoughts - could be an effective approach for managing affective symptoms among the sizeable proportion of people with bipolar disorder who have experienced childhood abuse. This study contributes a thorough investigation of the networks of affective symptoms among participants with and with no history of childhood abuse, albeit limited by the use of a binary, self-report measure of childhood abuse, thereby emphasising the importance of assessing for childhood abuse and taking needed steps towards identifying novel targets for treating bipolar disorder.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024.
