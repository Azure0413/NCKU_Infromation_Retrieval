Patients with self-reported race were categorized as White, Asian, or Black. We assessed the composite of first HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death, its components, and angioedema across races.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Among 12,097 participants, 9,451 (78.1%) were White, 2,116 (17.5%) were Asian, and 530 (4.4%) were Black. Over a median follow-up of 2.5 years, Black (adjusted HR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.42-1.98) and Asian patients (adjusted HR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.18-1.47) experienced higher risks of the primary outcome compared with White patients. Treatment effects of sacubitril/valsartan vs RASi on the primary endpoint were consistent among White (HR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.77-0.91), Asian (HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.78-1.10), and Black patients (HR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.58-1.07; P<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.58). Rates of severe angioedema were higher with sacubitril/valsartan vs RASi (White: 0.2% vs 0.1%; Black: 1.5% vs 0.0%; Asian: 0.1% vs 0.1%).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">In a pooled experience of 2 global trials, Black and Asian patients exhibited a higher risk of cardiovascular events than White patients. The benefits of sacubitril/valsartan were consistent across races. Risks of severe angioedema were low but numerically higher with sacubitril/valsartan.
