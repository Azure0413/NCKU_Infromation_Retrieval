This longitudinal study gathered data at two assessment points: Time 1, evaluation of infant and young child feeding practices and children's temperament when they were between 6 and 12 months, and Time 2, assessment of children's eating behaviors at age 2. This study included sociodemographic characteristics, the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire for Toddlers (CEBQ-T), the short form of Children Behavior Questionnaire (Revised IBQ-RSF), and the Infant Feeding Style Questionnaire (IFSQ) in eastern China. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was utilized to examine the pathways from three dimensions of early temperament to five types of children's eating behaviors mediated by three styles of infant and young child feeding practices. A total of 972 children, children's mean age was 14.58 ± 5.11 months, 464 (47.74%) being girls, while the mothers' mean age was 30.23 ± 3.56 years. Effortful control exhibited significant effects on food responsiveness and satiety responsiveness mediated by responsive feeding. Additionally, effortful control influenced enjoyment of food and satiety responsiveness mediated by restrictive feeding. Surgency had a significant effect on food responsiveness mediated by indulgent feeding. Negative affectivity impacted satiety responsiveness, enjoyment of food, and food responsiveness mediated by responsive feeding. This longitudinal study delineates the pathways from early temperament to eating behaviors mediated by infant and young child feeding practices among children aged 6-23 months. These findings highlight the need to prioritize intervention programs aimed at nurturing early temperament through appropriate infant and young child feeding practices to promote healthy eating behaviors for upper- and middle-income countries (UMICs) with similar contexts.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
