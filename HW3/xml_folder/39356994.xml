From February 2021 to June 2022, SCALE-UP Utah used text messaging interventions to reach 107â€‰846 patients from 28 clinics within seven safety-net health care systems. Interventions provided informational and motivational messaging regarding COVID-19 testing and vaccination, and were developed using extensive community partner input.
